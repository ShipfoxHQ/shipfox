# @shipfox/provisioner-ec2

Runs one-job Shipfox runners on Amazon EC2 from a prebaked AMI.

## What it does

- **Starts runners**: Creates a runner instance and one-use bootstrap token before launch.
- **Uses EC2 tags**: Finds and adopts its instances after a restart.
- **Keeps state in sync**: Reports state, reaps missed enrollment, and applies terminate requests.
- **Protects credentials**: Sends bootstrap data to the AMI. It never sends workspace registration credentials.

## Setup

Copy [`templates.example.yaml`](templates.example.yaml). Set
`SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_TEMPLATES_FILE` to that copy. Set `target_concurrency` above
zero to keep ready runners without demand.

The AMI must include the Shipfox runner and its shutdown watchdog. Cloud-init writes
`/etc/shipfox/runner.env` with the API URL, one-use token, labels, poll time, and
maximum lifetime. The AMI reads that file and shuts down when its watchdog exits.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHIPFOX_API_URL` | no | `https://api.shipfox.io` | Base URL of the Shipfox API. Set it for a self-hosted API. |
| `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_API_URL` | no | `SHIPFOX_API_URL` | API URL injected into runner instances when they reach the API through a different address. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_TOKEN` | yes | — | Long-lived provisioner token. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_TEMPLATES_FILE` | yes | — | Path to the EC2 template YAML file. |
| `AWS_REGION` | yes | — | AWS region where the provider launches instances. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_EC2_REGISTRATION_DEADLINE_MS` | no | `300000` | Maximum time an EC2 instance may remain pending without runner enrollment. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_EC2_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `60000` | Interval between full EC2/backend reconciliation passes. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_POLL_WAIT_SECONDS` | no | `30` | Demand long-poll duration. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `1000` | Delay between healthy demand polls. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_POLL_MAX_INTERVAL_MS` | no | `5000` | Maximum error-backoff interval. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_MAX_RESERVATIONS` | no | `250` | Largest demand reservation request. |
| `SHIPFOX_PROVISIONER_RUNNER_INSTANCE_BATCH_SIZE` | no | `250` | Runner instances created per control-plane request. |
| `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_POLL_MAX_DURATION_MS` | no | `300000` | Idle polling lifetime injected into each runner. |
| `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS` | no | `3600` | Hard lifetime injected into each runner watchdog. |
