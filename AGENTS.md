# Agent guidelines

`CLAUDE.md` is a compatibility alias for this file.

## Execution baseline

- Use mise-managed tools. Prefix non-interactive commands with `mise exec --`.
- Inspect the relevant files and local instructions before editing. Preserve
  unrelated user changes.
- Keep changes focused on the requested task. Do not change generated output,
  dependencies, versions, or release metadata unless the task requires it.
- Validate the changed package and its dependents before widening validation:

  ```sh
  turbo <task> --filter=@shipfox/<package>...
  ```

- Report the files changed, validation run, and any skipped checks or remaining
  risks.

## Read before editing

Read the linked source before making the matching change. For a task not listed
here, use the full [engineering documentation map](docs/README.md).
