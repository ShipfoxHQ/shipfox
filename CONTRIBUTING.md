# Contributing

This project and everyone participating in it are governed by the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to
uphold it.

## Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) manages the pinned Node.js, pnpm, Turbo, and
  Ollama versions.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) runs local service dependencies.

## Get started

Install the pinned tools and workspace dependencies:

```sh
mise install
mise exec -- pnpm install
```

Start local dependencies and build the repository:

```sh
docker compose up -d
mise exec -- turbo build
```

Use `mise exec --` for shell scripts and automation. Run `mise tasks` to find
repository tasks.

## Normal contribution loop

Make a focused change, then run the smallest validation that proves it. Start
with the changed package and its dependents:

```sh
mise exec -- turbo <task> --filter=@shipfox/<package>...
```

Before opening a pull request, run the validation required by the changed
surface and make sure the change is scoped to the contribution. The
[local development and release workflow](docs/guides/local-development-and-release-workflow.md)
owns task selection, affected-package validation, local-service recovery,
Conductor and Ollama recovery, Changesets, and package release procedures.

## Prepare a change for review

Use a focused feature branch. Do not commit or push directly to `main`. Name
the branch after the change. Include the lowercase Linear issue key when the
work has one.

Keep each commit independently reviewable. Use an imperative subject of about
70 characters or fewer. Do not end it with a period or add a co-author trailer.
Add a body when readers need the motivation or the previous behavior. Add a
footer such as `Refs ENG-123` when the commit needs an issue reference.

Write a pull request title that explains the change at a business level. Prefix
it with the package name in square brackets when one package owns the change.
In the description, explain the change and its motivation. Include alternatives
or review concerns when they matter. Do not add a test-plan checklist or repeat
the diff.

When a pull request completes its Linear issue, use `Closes`, `Fixes`, or
`Resolves` with the issue key. Use `Refs`, `Part of`, or `Related to` only when
the work is partial. Keep each pull request focused on one feature or fix.
