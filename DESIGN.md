# Design System: Shipfox

Shipfox is an AI software factory: engineers author workflows in YAML, events
start them, and shell and agent steps run on compute the team controls. The
center of gravity is the dashboard where those runs are watched, so this system
is built to instrument autonomous work, not to decorate it. The product this
system serves is recorded in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md).

**The code is canonical.** [The shared CSS](libs/shared/react/ui/index.css) and
the [`@shipfox/react-ui`](libs/shared/react/ui/) package hold the exact token and
component values. This document explains the system and its intent; the
frontmatter above is the machine-readable source of the primitives, recorded as
their light-mode canonical values. The semantic tokens named in each section flip
for dark mode, so tooling that needs theme-correct output resolves the named token
(for example `--background-button-inverted-default`) rather than the raw hex. When
code and prose disagree, the code wins and this file is corrected in the same
change.

The one exception is the surface, frame, and panel model. It is described under
[Layout](#layout), [Elevation and depth](#elevation-and-depth), and
[Panels](#panels), and recorded in the `panel`, `panel-header`, and `panel-row`
frontmatter entries. `@shipfox/react-ui` exposes the panel primitive, and callers
use it for data regions and focused titled blocks. One surface token still
resolves to a value other than the ones the ladder names, and [The surface
ladder](#the-surface-ladder) lists it.

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Glass Cockpit."**

A glass cockpit is the panel a pilot trusts at 2 AM: every readout is legible at a
glance, nothing moves that does not mean something, and the one warning light that
turns on is the one thing you look at. Shipfox is that panel for engineers flying
fleets of agents. The chrome is quiet and industrial. The data is where all the
life is: logs streaming, a run resolving, an agent thinking out loud, tokens and
cost ticking up. The interface earns trust by getting out of the way until
something needs attention, then pointing at exactly what.

The aesthetic is industrial and utilitarian, in the lineage of Linear, Vercel,
and Resend. Function first, data dense, monospace used as a structural element and
not a garnish. It is not brutalist (there is polish: layered shadows, rounded
corners, tuned contrast), not playful (no bouncy curves, no mascots), and not
editorial (this is an instrument, not a magazine). Both light and dark are
first-class: light leads for most surfaces, dark owns the code-heavy contexts
(logs, YAML, agent transcripts) and is honored whenever the user picks it.

The users live in terminals and read logs when things are on fire. They expect
figures that do not dance, status they can trust without reading the label twice,
keyboard reach, and zero marketing fluff inside the product. Every decision below
serves that reader.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Instrument-grade density.** Comfortable-compact by default. Take the denser of
  two reasonable options on app surfaces, the more spacious on marketing.
- **Monospace is structure.** Commit Mono carries everything a user types, copies,
  or pattern-matches. It is load-bearing, not decorative.
- **Orange is the warning light.** The brand accent marks focus, "you are here,"
  and the live edge. It is never a fill you reach for to feel branded.
- **Trustworthy status.** State is carried by shape and color together, never color
  alone. The UI must not lie to an operator.
- **Calm chrome, loud data.** Navigation and containers recede; runs, logs, and
  metrics are the loudest thing on screen.

## Colors

The palette is a warm-neutral canvas, one brand accent (Shipfox orange), and a
disciplined functional set for status. Color is organized in three layers, and
components always consume the highest layer that fits.

**Layer 1, primitives.** Raw scales in `index.css`: `--color-neutral-{0..1000}`,
`--color-primary-{50..950}`, `--color-{red,orange,green,blue,purple}-{50..950}`,
Apple-style `--color-accent-*`, and `--color-alpha-{black,white}-*` for
translucent overlays. **Never read a primitive from a component.** If the
semantic token you need does not exist, add it rather than reaching past the layer.

**Layer 2, semantic tokens.** Role tokens that flip between light and dark
automatically, so component code never branches on theme. The families:

- Backgrounds: the four surface roles are defined in
  [Elevation and depth](#elevation-and-depth) and are the only tokens that
  paint a page, a panel, or a code block. The rest of the family covers states and
  overlays: `-neutral-hover` / `-pressed`, `-components-hover` / `-pressed`,
  `-field-base` / `-field-hover` (inputs), `-neutral-overlay` (popovers),
  `-highlight-{base,hover,interactive}` (brand-tied selection), `-modal-overlay` /
  `-backdrop-backdrop` (scrims), and `-accent-{neutral,blue,purple,success,warning,error}-{soft,base,strong}`.
  The former neutral background role is retired; use the canvas token for page
  surfaces.
- Foregrounds: `text-foreground-neutral-{base,subtle,muted,disabled}`,
  `-on-color` (on a saturated fill), `-on-inverted` (on a contrast surface),
  `-highlight-interactive` (link/CTA orange), `-highlight-error`.
- Borders: `border-border-neutral-{base,strong}`,
  `-highlights-interactive` (focus/active), `-highlights-{error,danger}`.

**Layer 3, component tokens.** Per-family sets that compose base, hover, pressed,
focus, and disabled for one component: `--background-button-*`, `--shadow-button-*`,
`--checkbox-*-*`. Do not clone these onto a new component; extend the layer.

### Primary

- **Shipfox Orange** (`brand` / `brand-deep`, `--color-primary-400` / `-500`): the
  single brand accent. `brand` is the inline-link and foreground accent
  (`--foreground-highlight-interactive`) in both themes, and the brand mark.
  `brand-deep` is the button focus ring at every theme, and the light-mode
  highlight surface (`--background-highlight-interactive`, which flips to `brand`
  in dark). `brand-tint` (`--color-primary-50`) is the faintest interactive wash
  on hover.

### Neutral

- **Ink** (`ink`, `--color-neutral-950`): primary text on light.
- **Subtle / Muted** (`subtle` `--color-neutral-600`, `muted` `--color-neutral-500`):
  secondary text and metadata.
- **Canvas / Panel** (`canvas` `--color-neutral-50`, `panel`
  `--color-neutral-0`): the page and the panels that sit on it, on light.
- **Panel Inverted** (`panel-inverted`, `--color-neutral-900`): the near-black
  code surface on light. Dark targets `--color-neutral-1000`, so code becomes the
  darkest surface in both themes. Dark resolves to `--color-neutral-800` today.
- **Border** (`border`, `--color-neutral-300`): the default hairline.

Dark mode inverts these roles through the same token names (the page becomes
`--color-neutral-950`, ink becomes `--color-neutral-100`, and so on); write once,
both themes resolve.

### Status and functional

Status is a functional palette, not a set of decorative secondaries. Each hue has
a dedicated `--tag-*` family (background, hover, border, text, icon) so pills flip
cleanly in dark mode. Consume them through the `Badge` component; never fabricate a
custom colored pill.

- **Running** (`running`, blue) for active execution.
- **Succeeded** (`succeeded`, green) for terminal success.
- **Failed** (`failed`, red) for failure, runner-lost, and timed-out.
- **Warning** (`warning`, orange) for manual gates and attention (awaiting runner).
- **Meta** (`meta`, purple) reserved for non-status taxonomy only: environment,
  tier, "internal" or "experimental" markers.
- **Neutral** for pending, queued, delayed, cancelled, and skipped.

The canonical run, job, and step states map onto these: `pending` / `queued` /
`delayed` neutral, `running` blue, `awaiting-runner` / `awaiting-manual` warning,
`succeeded` green, `failed` / `runner-disappeared` / `timed-out` red, `cancelled`
/ `skipped` dimmed neutral. Trigger and delivery surfaces reuse the same taxonomy
(`received` neutral, `routed` blue, `failed` red, and so on).

**The Warning-Light Rule.** Brand orange marks four things and nothing else:
the focus ring (always), the active or selected surface ("you are here"), inline
links, and the brand mark. It is deliberately *not* the primary button (that is
inverted neutral) and *not* a status hue (warning orange is a different scale,
`--color-orange-*`, from brand `--color-primary-*`). If you reach for orange to
make something feel branded, stop. The brand lives in monospace, density,
restraint, and that one precise ring.

<!-- vale off -->
**The Shape-Not-Just-Color Rule.** Status is never carried by color alone
(WCAG 1.4.1). A glyph shape or a written word always co-signs the hue, and the
status color lives in the dot, pill, glyph, or border, never as a full row or panel
fill (which fights zebra rhythm and dark mode).
<!-- vale on -->

## Typography

**Display and UI Font:** IBM Plex Sans (self-hosted variable, weights 100 to 700,
Latin subsets, with italics). Fallback `sans-serif`.
**Code Font:** Commit Mono (self-hosted, weights 400 and 700). Fallback `monospace`.

**Character:** IBM Plex Sans adds a restrained technical character while staying
legible at 13 to 14px; Commit Mono carries warmth across the heavy log, YAML, and
SHA surfaces. `html` enables OpenType `rlig`, `calt`, and `lnum`, so digits are
tabular by default in both families: durations, run numbers, and counters do not
jitter when they update.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (IBM Plex Sans Medium, `text-4xl` 40px / `text-5xl` 56px): marketing hero
  only.
- **Headline** (IBM Plex Sans Medium, `text-3xl` 28px/44, `text-2xl` 24px/32): page titles
  and sub-headings.
- **Title** (IBM Plex Sans Medium, `text-xl` 18px/28, `text-lg` 16px/24): section headings
  and panel headings.
- **Body** (IBM Plex Sans Regular, `text-md` 14px/24): default copy, form labels, button
  labels at md. `text-sm` 13px/20 for table body and helper text.
- **Label** (IBM Plex Sans Medium, `text-xs` 12px/20): tags, metadata, table footers.
- **Code** (Commit Mono, `text-sm` 13px/20): everything monospace.

Weights are regular (400) by default, medium (500) for headings and emphasized
labels, bold (700) rare and reserved for code emphasis or alert titles.

**The Use-The-Components Rule.** Typography flows through `Header`, `Text`, and
`Code` (`components/typography/*`). Write `<Header variant="h1">` and
`<Text size="sm">`, never a raw `<h1 class="text-3xl font-medium">`. Inlining the
scale scatters type decisions across the codebase.

**The Monospace-Is-Structure Rule.** Reach for `font-code` whenever the content is
something a user types, copies, or pattern-matches: source, YAML, JSON, logs and
command output, SHAs, IDs, paths, refs, URLs, durations, byte counts, sequence and
line numbers, capability tokens, and environment or tag values. Numbers written as
prose ("14 jobs failed") stay in `font-display`; numbers presented as data stay in
`font-code`.

## Layout

**The spatial model is grid-disciplined in the app, editorial only on marketing
and auth.** Marketing gets asymmetry and air. Settings and admin look like the run
viewer, not the marketing page.

**App shell.** Top header 56px, sticky, holding the logo, workspace crumb, project
crumb, and user menu. A 40px tab strip sits sticky directly beneath. The strip is
always reserved and renders even when empty, so navigation never jumps.

A surface may also carry a left rail: the run workspace nav at 240px, or the
settings nav at 180px. A rail is navigation, so it follows the chrome rules in
[Elevation and depth](#elevation-and-depth). It also sits inside the page
frame rather than pinning to the viewport edge, so it never drifts away from the
content it belongs to. A details right rail, when present, is 360 to 420px.

### Frames

**Every route declares one frame, and the shell owns all three.** A page never
sets its own background and never sets its own width. Both come from the frame.

| Frame | Width | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | 1120px centered | Settings, forms, object configuration, indexes |
| `data` | Full width, no cap | Run lists, run and job views, logs, tables |
| `focused` | 640px centered, bare layout | Auth, onboarding, callbacks |

Both capped frames center inside `px-frame` gutters. The `data` frame keeps the
same gutters at every width. Data surfaces run edge to edge on purpose, because a
wide log or run table shows more per screen. The panel border supplies the edge
the eye tracks against.

The run workspace uses the surrounding `data` frame. Its 240px rail and run-level
panels use the frame's full width and fixed gutters. Dedicated job views keep their
log content full width within the surrounding data surface.

Marketing sits outside this model. It keeps a single content column up to about
1280px, generous vertical rhythm, and full-bleed background panels.

### Page headings

**App pages carry no title and no description.** The nav bar and the tab strip
already say where the reader is, so a page title repeats them. A description never
survives its title; the two are removed together.

Two things follow:

- **List controls live in the panel header strip.** Search, filters, and the
  primary action belong to the panel they act on, not to the page.
- **Object identity is not a page title.** A run header keeps its status pill,
  name, trigger, and duration, because those name the object rather than the page.

Settings sub-pages are the exception and keep a bare title. The settings nav
provides the navigation context and active state, but it is not a content
heading, so the title stays in the page content.

### Spacing

**The Pixel-Spacing Rule.** `index.css` sets `--spacing: 1px`, so in this Tailwind
v4 setup **utility numbers are pixels**: `p-16` is 16px, `gap-8` is 8px, and `h-32`
is 32px. This is *not* stock Tailwind, where `p-4` would be 16px. Here `p-4` is
4px. The raw scale remains useful for token definitions and component internals.
Product surfaces should use the semantic roles below.

**Semantic spacing roles.** Values are listed as `default / compact` pixels.
Compact values apply below an ancestor with `data-density="compact"`.

| Family | Roles |
| --- | --- |
| Gaps | `gap-tight` 4 / 2, `gap-inline` 8 / 4, `gap-cluster` 12 / 8, `gap-group` 16 / 12, `gap-section` 24 / 16, `gap-region` 32 / 24 |
| Axis gaps | `gap-x-*` and `gap-y-*` in the same six roles and the same values, for a grid whose column and row rhythm differ |
| Padding | `p-menu-surface` 4 / 2, `p-tight` and `px-tight` 8 / 4, `px-row` 16 / 12, `py-row` 12 / 8, `p-panel-compact` and `pt-panel-compact` 16 / 12, `p-panel` and `pb-panel` 24 / 16, `px-frame` 24 / 16, `py-frame` 32 / 24 |
| Margins | `ms-inline` 8 / 4, `my-region` 32 / 24, `mt-page` 48 / 32, `-mt-inline`, `-mr-inline`, and `-mx-inline` -8 / -4 |

Use a parent `gap-*` role before adding a child margin, and reach for `gap-x-*`
or `gap-y-*` only when the two axes genuinely differ. Use the negative inline
roles only to preserve a touch target's optical alignment with its containing
surface; `-mx-inline` cancels a `px-tight` row so the bleed tracks density
instead of freezing at one pixel value. Keep zero utilities for explicit resets.
Use arbitrary spacing only for a fixed optical offset, reserved control space, or
asymmetric component contract that has no semantic role.

**Density posture.** The default medium button is `h-32`; component sizing owns its
padding. Use `gap-group` for form row rhythm, `p-panel` for a panel without rows, and
`px-row` or `py-row` for row controls. A surface is at the wrong density when a
table needs horizontal scroll from cell padding, when an app page shows more
whitespace than content above the fold, or when a marketing page feels like a
settings panel.

## Elevation and depth

### The surface ladder

**Four roles, four tokens, and the same number of steps in both themes.**
Components always consume the token, never the hex. The frontmatter names the
first two surfaces after the same roles, as `colors.canvas` and `colors.panel`.

| Role | Token | Light | Dark | Paints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | `bg-background-subtle-base` | `#fafafa` | `#0f0f10` | The page, the nav bar, the tab strip, rails, object headers, panel header strips |
| Panel | `bg-background-neutral-base` | `#ffffff` | `#1a1a1b` | Panel bodies, rows, modals |
| Code | `bg-background-contrast-base` | `#1a1a1b` | `#030303` | Code, logs, YAML, agent transcripts |
| Inline fill | `bg-background-components-base` | `#f4f4f5` | `#27272a` | Avatars, badges, kbd, chips inside a panel |

**Those hexes are the target, and one token does not resolve to them yet.** Read
this table as the contract the package is moving to.

| Token | Resolves today | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--background-contrast-base` (dark) | `--color-neutral-800` | `--color-neutral-1000` |

`--background-contrast-subtle` and `--background-contrast-hover` are translucent
in dark today and become opaque in the same change.

**Overlays sit outside this ladder.** A popover uses
`--background-neutral-overlay`, a tooltip uses its own variant tokens, and a modal
uses the panel fill. None of them is a page surface, so none is governed by the
four roles above.

Two rules generate the ladder:

- **Panel sits one ramp step toward the foreground from canvas, in both themes.**
  A panel header strip sits one step back from its panel, which lands on the
  canvas value. That is why one token paints both the page and the strip.
- **Code is the darkest surface in both themes.** Code reads better on near-black
  even on light, so it does not follow the theme.

**The Opaque-Surface Rule.** No page, panel, or code surface uses an alpha token.
A translucent surface composites over its parent, and the parent varies by route,
so the same component would render a different color on different pages.

**Inline fill is not a surface.** It is a chip on top of one. Never use it as the
background of a page or a panel.

### Chrome and panels

**Chrome is bare on the canvas. Every data region is a bordered panel.**

Navigation, page frame, rails, and object headers sit directly on the canvas.
Hairlines and spacing separate them, never a border or a radius. Anything holding
data sits in a panel instead: 1px hairline, `rounded-8`, panel fill, an optional
header strip, and hairline row dividers.

**A panel never contains another panel.** Where a page wants a grid of tiles, the
tiles are cells inside one panel divided by internal hairlines. A bordered tile
inside a panel is two frames around one thing.

### Shadow vocabulary

Depth is also conveyed by **multi-layer token-driven shadows**, not by flat tonal
layering alone. Every interactive surface composes a stack: a hairline top
highlight, a 1px key-line border, and one or two soft ambient drops. These stacks
are theme-aware inside the token, so a component never sets a raw shadow.

- **`--shadow-border-base`**: the default surface and input keyline (hairline ring
  plus faint drop). The resting elevation for fields and bordered chips.
- **`--shadow-button-inverted` / `-neutral` / `-danger` / `-success`**: the
  per-variant button stacks (key-line in the variant color plus ambient drop).
- **`--shadow-button-*-focus`**: the same stack plus a 2px halo and a 4px
  `--color-primary-500` ring. This is the button focus affordance; fields and
  inputs compose their own `--shadow-border-interactive-with-active` ring.
- **`--shadow-focus-inset`**: the inset focus ring, in `--color-primary-500` and
  theme-invariant, for a control whose parent clips an outset ring.
- **`--shadow-tooltip`**: the lifted stack for tooltips and popovers.
- **`--shadow-separator-inset`**: an inset top-highlight / bottom-shadow pair for
  hairline dividers inside dark panels.

**The Token-Only Shadow Rule.** Never write a custom `box-shadow` hex. Custom
shadows break in dark mode because they miss the theme-aware alpha layering the
tokens carry. If you need a new elevation, add a token.

**The Flat-Focus-Ring Rule.** An orange focus ring is universal and never
stripped, though the exact token differs by family: buttons compose
`--shadow-button-*-focus` (a `--color-primary-500` ring) and fields compose
`--shadow-border-interactive-with-active`. If a container's `overflow-hidden`
would clip the standard outset ring (as inside a log row frame or a panel cell),
switch that one control to `--shadow-focus-inset`, never remove it. A state that
is not focus never consumes the focus `box-shadow`: encode it in the border, a
fill, or a glyph instead, or the focused element stops announcing itself.

## Shapes

The form language is **softly rounded, tight radii, hairline borders.** Corners
signal role, not decoration, and the radius scale is fixed:

- **4px** (`rounded-4`): inputs and status pills.
- **6px** (`rounded-6`): buttons and small chips. The default component corner.
- **8px** (`rounded-8`): panels and popovers.
- **10px** (`rounded-10`): modals and sheets.
- **12 to 16px**: marketing tiles and hero cards.
- **`rounded-full`**: avatars, status dots, and icon-only circular buttons.

Borders are 1px hairlines in `border-border-neutral-base`, used between table rows
in place of zebra fills. Silhouettes stay rectangular and calm; there are no
organic blobs, no clipped diagonals, no decorative geometry. Buttons are `rounded-6`,
pills are `rounded-4` or `rounded-full`, panels are `rounded-8`. Do not drift.

## Components

`@shipfox/react-ui` ships the batteries. Reach for an existing component before
building anything: `accordion`, `alert`, `avatar`, `badge`, `button`, `calendar`,
`callout`, `code-block`, `collapsible`, `combobox`, `command`,
`date-picker`, `date-range-picker`, `dot`, `dropdown-menu`, `empty-state`,
`form-field`, `icon`, `input`, `kbd`, `label`, `load-error-state`, `loader`, `log`,
`logo`, `markdown`, `modal`, `panel`, `popover`, `radio-group`, `relative-time`,
`scroll-area`, `search`, `select`, `sheet`, `shiny-text`, `skeleton`, `table`,
`tabs`, `theme`, `toast`, `tooltip`, and `typography`.

`Panel` is the container for a data region and a focused titled block.

### Buttons

- **Shape:** `rounded-6`. Sizes `2xs` (20px), `xs` (24), `sm` (28), `md` (32,
  default), `lg` (36), `xl` (40). Tables and run-viewer toolbars trend to `sm`;
  marketing CTAs to `lg`.
- **Primary:** inverted neutral fill (near-black on light, a mid-tone neutral on dark),
  `--background-button-inverted-*`. This is the dominant action in a form, modal,
  or header. It is deliberately not orange: primary actions recur constantly in
  tables and modals, and an orange fill would exhaust the eye and compete with
  status.
- **Secondary:** neutral surface, soft `--shadow-button-neutral`, subtle border.
- **Danger** (red) / **Success** (green): destructive and explicit-confirm actions;
  success is rare.
- **Transparent / TransparentMuted:** no fill, hover wash. The correct variant for
  inline icon buttons, table row actions, and nav items. Full primary buttons
  inside table rows scream; use these instead.

### Chips / Badges

- **Status badge:** `Badge` with a `--tag-*` family, `rounded-4` or `rounded-full`,
  `text-xs`. When state is the headline of a panel or header, the pill is **color
  plus word only**: no leading glyph or dot inside a pill (a circle within a
  rounded border is too many surfaces in a small space).

### Panels

`Panel` is the only container for a data region, replacing `Card`. It
composes `PanelHeader`, `PanelTitle`, `PanelActions`, `PanelBody`, `PanelRow`,
`PanelGrid`, `PanelCell`, `PanelCellAction`, and `PanelEmpty`.

- **Shell:** `rounded-8`, panel fill, hairline border, elevation from the shadow
  tokens.
- **Header:** `PanelHeader` defaults to a `strip` variant on the canvas fill with
  a hairline underneath. It carries the title or the list controls on the left and
  the primary action on the right. The `plain` variant drops the strip and the
  hairline, for a titled block on a focused surface.
- **Body:** rows use `px-row` and `py-row` with hairline dividers, and the last row
  drops its divider. A panel without rows uses `p-panel` (`p-panel-compact` when
  compact).
- **Grid:** `PanelGrid` lays `PanelCell` children out in two columns divided by
  hairlines, collapsing to one column at 760px. The dividers come from
  `nth-child` rules on the grid, so no caller passes an index. An odd cell count
  is padded with an inert cell, so both rules reach the last row and a half-full
  row reads as a grid with one empty cell rather than a single wide row. Never
  build a grid of tiles by giving each tile its own border.
- **States:** empty, error, and loading states render inside the body. A list with
  zero rows keeps the same footprint and border as a list with rows.
- **`asChild`:** `Panel`, `PanelBody`, `PanelRow`, and `PanelCellAction` accept
  `asChild`, so a panel can be an `aside`, a row list can keep `ul` and `li`
  semantics, and a cell action can be a router `Link`.

Never tint a panel or a row background to match a status. Never hand-roll the
panel class string: a bordered surface that is not a `Panel` drifts from it
within one release.

### The three interactive surface roles

A rounded, bordered tile with a hover wash can mean three different things, and
the product uses all three. They share one surface vocabulary and are told apart
by their affordance, never by their silhouette alone.

| Role | Primitive | Affordance | Persists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Choose one of N | `RadioGroupItem` | leading radio dot | yes |
| Navigate or open | `PanelCell` + `PanelCellAction` | trailing verb and chevron | no |
| Row with inline actions | `PanelRow` | hover wash, actions revealed on hover | no |

A picker carries its own frame only on the canvas. A radio tile and a panel share
four properties: radius, border, fill, and shadow. Inside a panel the picker
takes `RadioGroup variant="cell"`, which drops the radius, the border, and the
shadow, since repeating the panel's own frame is a frame inside a frame. Only the
fill stays, because a cell still has to paint over the surface behind it. A cell
has no resting outline, so selection draws one only when checked, using `outline`
rather than `box-shadow` so the focus ring stays readable underneath it.

The leading dot and the trailing chevron are a matched pair of opposites: one
says this becomes selected, the other says this takes you elsewhere. Dropping
either one makes a choice and a link indistinguishable.

Each primitive owns its own affordance, so no caller draws either mark by hand:
`RadioGroupItem` renders its dot, and `PanelCellAction` renders the verb and
chevron from its `action` prop. A cell that navigates without an `action` is
missing the mark that tells it apart from a choice.

Selection is carried by the dot **and** the border together, never by border
colour alone: orange is also the focus ring, so a colour-only selected state
collides with focus and fails the use-of-colour rule. Because the dot carries
selection, `box-shadow` on a radio item is free to mean focus and only focus,
which is what keeps the already-checked item (the first tab stop under a roving
tabindex) visibly focusable.

Navigation never wears a standalone bordered tile. A grid of openable things is
`PanelCell`s inside one `PanelGrid`, exactly as a list of openable things is
`PanelRow`s inside one `PanelBody`.

### Inputs / Fields

- `h-32` default, `--shadow-border-base` treatment, `text-md` body, `rounded-4`.
- **Labels** `Text size="sm"` medium; **helper** `Text size="xs"` muted; **error**
  `text-foreground-highlight-error` at `text-xs`. Focus shows the orange ring.

### Navigation

- **TabsList** uses `gap-group` between triggers so multiword labels read as
  separate choices. Consumers and stories inherit this spacing from the shared component.
- **NavBar** `h-56`, sticky, `bg-background-subtle-base`, hairline bottom border,
  holding a theme-aware `Logo`, split-affordance workspace and project crumbs (name
  links to the entity, chevron opens a `Command`+`Popover` switcher), and a
  `UserMenu` on a 28px avatar with the theme switcher and logout.
- **ProjectTabs** `h-40`, sticky under the nav, always rendered; the active tab
  carries `border-b-2 border-border-highlights-interactive` and the indicator slide
  respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Signature: the status glyph

Run, job, and step state in a dense node or row is drawn by `WorkflowStatusIcon`
(in `client-workflows`, composing the shared `Icon` and `Dot`): a circular glyph in
the saturated `--tag-*-icon` tone leading the row. A bold masked ring for pending
(not a thin dotted outline), check / X / slash discs for succeeded / failed /
cancelled-skipped (terminal neutrals dimmed), and a filled disc with an external
pulsing ripple halo for the live running state (one motion treatment, no spinner;
`motion-safe` only, degrading to a static disc under reduced motion). The glyph
carries the status as its accessible name (`role="img"` + `aria-label`) and a hover
tooltip. A 6px `Dot` is for pure presence, never for job state.

### Signature: code, log, and config surfaces

Multi-line code, log, and YAML content always renders in `font-code`, `text-sm`, on
the inverted contrast surface (`bg-background-contrast-base`) in both themes, since
code reads better on near-black even in light mode. Default to no-wrap with
horizontal scroll (engineers reach for soft-wrap themselves), show line numbers in
`text-foreground-neutral-muted`, and surface validation errors as a `Callout` above
the block with file and line, never color alone. New log lines append silently:
appending 50 lines a second with an entrance animation is nausea.

### Notices, icons, and loaders

- **`Callout`** is the canonical static notice (quiet neutral surface, saturated
  status side-line, `default` / `info` / `success` / `warning` / `error`) for
  inline guidance, form and server errors, and authored annotation cards. `Alert`
  is reserved for dismissible or animated notices.
- **`Icon`** wraps Remix Icon, Lucide, and custom Shipfox marks, sized with
  `size-*`. Use `@remixicon/react` for app utility icons and `lucide-react` for the
  warmer marketing icons, and never mix the two styles in one surface.
- **`ShipfoxLoader`** is the brand spinner for page-level and blocking loads; the
  inline `Icon name="spinner"` goes inside buttons and small spots.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- **Do** carry status with shape and color together, and keep the status color in
  the glyph, pill, or border (never a full row or panel fill).
- **Do** route every color through a semantic or component token. A raw `#RRGGBB`
  outside `index.css` is a bug; push it into a token.
- **Do** use the typography components (`Header`, `Text`, `Code`) for all type.
- **Do** keep tables tight: sticky header, hairline row borders (not zebra),
  right-aligned tabular numerics, row hover surface, and inline actions in
  `transparent` / `transparentMuted` revealed on hover. A table always sits in a
  panel, and the panel owns the border and the radius.
- **Do** declare a frame on every route, and let the shell own the page background
  and the page width.
- **Do** respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: disable pulsing indicators and tab
  transitions, and give every icon-only button an `aria-label`.
- **Do** reserve motion for discrete events (150 to 250 ms ease-out for a state
  flip or a panel entering); let high-frequency data (logs, polling counters) swap
  silently.
- **Do** let marketing breathe more (`text-5xl` heads, `gap-64` sections) while
  keeping the same restraint.

### Don't:

- **Don't** make the primary button orange. Primary is inverted neutral; orange is
  the focus ring, the "you are here," and the link.
- **Don't** treat `p-4` as 16px. It is 4px here. This diverges from stock Tailwind.
- **Don't** write a custom `box-shadow`; use the `--shadow-*` tokens or add one, or
  dark mode breaks.
- **Don't** put decorative gradients on CTAs, or icons-in-colored-circles feature
  grids, or centered-everything hero triplets on marketing. Engineers smell hype a
  block away.
- **Don't** animate append-only high-frequency data, or tint a panel or row
  background to match a status.
- **Don't** set a background or a width on a page. Both belong to the frame.
- **Don't** nest a panel inside a panel, and don't give a navigation rail a border
  or a radius.
- **Don't** add a page title or a page description to an app surface. Settings
  sub-pages are the one exception.
- **Don't** paint a page, panel, or code surface with an alpha token. It
  composites over a parent that varies by route.
- **Don't** mix icon styles (Lucide next to Remix) in the same toolbar.
- **Don't** expand brand orange into status, or `meta` purple into running-state
  semantics.
