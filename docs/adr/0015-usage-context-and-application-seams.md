# Architecture decision record 0015: Usage context and application seams

- **Status:** Accepted.
- **Date:** 2026-09-03.
- **Decision owners:** Server architecture, client composition maintainers, and job admission.
- **Linear issue:** [ENG-1900](https://linear.app/shipfox/issue/ENG-1900/record-the-usage-context-analytics-boundary-pricing-seam-and-admission).
- **Amends:** [ADR 0001: Public client composition contract](0001-client-composition-contract.md)
  and [ADR 0002: Server inter-module architecture](0002-api-inter-module-architecture.md).
- **Related:** [ADR 0006: Database ownership boundaries](0006-database-ownership-boundaries.md),
  [ADR 0008: Administration controls](0008-administration-controls.md), and
  [ADR 0013: Workspace setup composition seams](0013-workspace-setup-composition-seams.md).

## Context

**Usage facts are spread across three owners.** Job execution timestamps live in Workflows.
Runner identity lives in Runners. Inference requests live in the gateway that served them. No
context owns a durable record per job execution or per inference segment. A consumer would have
to correlate raw lifecycle events across the three owners. It could never replay a period after
the outbox prunes dispatched rows.

**The composition contracts have no seam for usage.** The ADR 0002 context map lists the
contexts as of 2026-07-19 and has no Usage context. The ADR 0001 client composition contract has
one optional application-provided implementation, `ClientAnalytics` from ADR 0013, and no seam
for pricing. The job-admission inventory has one gate, the Workspace operating state, and no way
for a composition root to add its own admission rule.

## Decision

**This record introduces the Usage bounded context and names what a composing application can
instrument from outside it.** It defines architecture contracts only. Later work implements them
in `@shipfox/api-usage`, `@shipfox/api-usage-dto`, `@shipfox/client-usage`,
`@shipfox/client-shell`, `@shipfox/api-workflows`, and `@shipfox/api-triggers`.

### What the Usage context does

**Usage owns canonical usage facts.** It is a new bounded context in the ADR 0002 map:

| Bounded context | Packages |
| --- | --- |
| Usage | `@shipfox/api-usage`, `@shipfox/api-usage-dto`, and `@shipfox/client-usage`. |

The context owns two kinds of record:

| Record | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| Job execution | Opaque ids down to the job execution. Requested and runner labels. Template key, provisioner id and scope, provider kind, and launch kind. Queued, started, finished, and lease-expired times. Status, duration, and state. |
| Inference segment | A producer-supplied segment key. Opaque ids down to the step attempt. Upstream, model, and response dialect. An hour window, a request count, and the reported token classes. |

**Facts come from committed events and one inter-module command.** Usage subscribes to
`workflows.job_execution.queued`, `runners.job.claimed`, `runners.job.lease_expired`, and
`workflows.job_execution.terminated`. Every handler is an idempotent write keyed on the
producer's ids. An inference source records segments through `recordInferenceSegments` in the
`@shipfox/api-usage-dto/inter-module` export.

**Handlers accept any arrival order.** Workflows and Runners events order on different keys, so
the four events can reach Usage in any order and more than once. Each handler writes only its own
fields:

| Event | Fields the handler writes |
| --- | --- |
| `workflows.job_execution.queued` | Ids, requested labels, and the queued time. |
| `runners.job.claimed` | The started time and runner identity. |
| `runners.job.lease_expired` | The lease-expired time. |
| `workflows.job_execution.terminated` | Status, duration, the finished time, and the terminal state. |

A row in the terminal state never leaves it. A late claimed or lease-expired event fills only its
own fields and never changes status, duration, or state.

**Segment keys are unique across sources.** A producer prefixes the key with its `source` value
and composes it from the identifiers that define the segment. Two sources cannot collide, and one
source cannot reuse a key for a different segment. A repeated key is a duplicate: Usage counts it
and does not record it twice.

**Usage reads no peer table and calls no peer contract.** It depends on the Workflows and Runners
events being self-sufficient. The terminated event carries every field a usage record needs, so
a late claimed event only fills display fields.

**Usage publishes two outbox events.** `usage.job_execution.recorded` orders on the workflow run
id. `usage.inference_segment.recorded` orders on the step attempt id. Each is published once, in
the same transaction as the row, guarded by the row's `recorded_at`. Both payloads carry the
record as it stood at publication. A late claimed event may still fill display fields in the row
afterwards. A consumer that needs those fields reads the row or the list cursors.

**Usage exposes per-entity read routes only.** One route returns the usage of a workflow run.
One route returns the usage of a job execution. Both routes are workspace-scoped. The workspace id
is a path parameter, and the route requires workspace access the way other workspace routes do.
It returns only rows that belong to that workspace. There is no per-definition list route, and
the workflow runs list carries no usage data. Aggregates such as period totals, time series, or
top-N views are out of scope for this context. They need their own tables and retention, and a
consumer builds them from the events and list cursors below.

**Usage holds quantities, never amounts.** No table, event, route, DTO, or client component in
the context carries a price, an amount, a currency, or a rate.

**The context follows the existing ownership rules.** Its database namespace is `usage` and its
tables use the `usage_` prefix under ADR 0006. Rows are retained for a configured number of days
and dropped by whole partition. It is classified in `api-contexts.cjs` as `usage`,
with `libs/api/usage` as the implementation and `libs/api/usage-dto` as the DTO package. The
application root registers it in the default module set before the dispatcher, so its
subscribers are live before any enriched event flows.

### What can be instrumented from outside

Three points let a composing application build on Usage without changing upstream code.

#### Events and list cursors

A consumer subscribes to the two `usage.*` events through the dispatcher, and replays a period
through `listJobExecutionUsage` and `listInferenceSegments` in the inter-module export. It
depends only on `@shipfox/api-usage-dto`. Usage rows are the durable record; replay never depends
on the outbox.

#### The `usagePricing` client seam

**`composeClientApp()` accepts an optional `usagePricing` implementation.** Features read it
through `useUsagePricing()` from `@shipfox/client-shell/runtime`. The seam follows the
`ClientAnalytics` precedent from ADR 0013: an application-provided implementation, optional at
composition, with no default implementation in the shell.

The interface has three operations:

`resolveCosts` receives `UsagePricingReference` values with the opaque workspace UUID that owns
each run, job execution, or step attempt. Usage carries this identity from its records so the
pricing implementation can authorize the lookup against the selected workspace and fence its
cache by workspace. The implementation must not derive it from a URL slug, router state, or
mutable global state. Model-scoped step references retain their model and upstream identity.

| Operation | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `resolveCosts(refs)` | Batched resolved amounts for job executions, step attempts, or runs. |
| `estimate(input)` | An estimate for in-flight or unresolved work from the application's current rates. |
| `formatMoney(amount)` | Locale and currency formatting owned by the implementation. |

**Usage components render quantities only when the seam is absent.** A cost column, total, or
chip appears only when the seam returns a value for that entity. Each cost shows one of three
states. `resolved` means the implementation holds a final amount. `estimated` covers work in
flight or work without a final amount. Absent means no pricing is composed. Components in
`@shipfox/client-usage` never import an application package and never compute an amount from a
hard-coded price.

**A failing implementation degrades to the absent state.** A thrown error or rejected promise
from the implementation cannot break a run or job page. The shell isolates the failure the way
it isolates analytics failures, and the affected components render quantities for that request.

#### The workflow admission policy seam

**`createWorkflowsModule` accepts an optional admission policy.** The option has the same shape
as the Runners installation provisioning policy. It is an optional object with one `policy` field
on the module factory. The default composition threads it through its module options. No policy
configured means admit, so existing behavior is unchanged.

The policy has one method:

```ts
interface WorkflowAdmissionPolicy {
  admit(input: {workspaceId: string; source: string; definitionId: string}): Promise<
    {allowed: true} | {allowed: false; reason: string; requiredAction?: RequiredAction}
  >;
}

interface RequiredAction {
  reason: string;
  message: string;
  url: string;
}
```

`reason` is a stable kebab-case code owned by the policy, such as `workspace-quota-exhausted`.
`requiredAction` tells a user what to do and where. Its
`url` is an absolute `https` URL or an application-relative path chosen by the policy. Surfaces
render it as a trusted link and never derive it from request input. Every surface that shows a
denial renders that one object rather than inventing its own text.

**Workflows calls the policy beside the operating-state gate.** Every path in the job-admission
inventory calls it: manual run, scheduled run, integration webhook to a trigger, listener `fire`
deliveries, and rerun. `resolve` deliveries stay exempt because they terminate existing listener
work. The operating-state gate runs first. A suspended workspace reports `workspace-suspended`,
never a policy reason, so administrator suspension under ADR 0008 stays separate from any
application policy.

**A denial is permanent and recorded.** Workflows returns the denial to its caller as one known
error, `admission-denied`, on `startRunFromTrigger`, `startDevRun`, and
`deliverEventToJobListener`. Its details carry the workspace id, the `reason`, and the optional
`requiredAction`. Triggers records the denial in trigger history and skips the event, the way it
records `workspace-suspended` today. It never retries a denial and never queues work for it.
Manual starts and reruns surface the reason and `requiredAction` in the HTTP response as a stable
error code with details.

**The policy vocabulary lives in `reason`, not in error codes.** A new policy reason never adds a
known error to the contract. Under ADR 0002, adding the `admission-denied` known error is a
breaking contract change once, and the release that adds it follows that rule. Later reasons are
additive.

**A policy failure is transient, not a denial.** A policy that throws or exceeds the call
timeout is an unknown failure. Workflows bounds every `admit()` call with a timeout, so a hanging
policy cannot hold an admission path open. Callers keep their existing retry budgets.
Trigger and listener paths follow the dispatcher's retry and dead-letter rules. Manual starts and
reruns fail the HTTP request. A policy outage delays work instead of discarding it. Only an
explicit `allowed: false` result is permanent.

**Upstream records no policy state.** The policy owner records its own side effects. `admit()`
can run more than once for one logical admission, because callers retry after a lost response
and the dispatcher redelivers at least once. A policy keys its side effects idempotently, the way
Usage handlers do. Workflows and Triggers store the reason string and nothing else about the
policy.

### Admission is decided server-side only

The client sends the request and renders the `requiredAction` the server returns. It does not
check a policy before it starts a run. It shows no blocking dialog at launch time and never
disables a run action from a policy fact. Runs are triggered by external events as often as by a person, so a
client gate would cover a minority of admissions. The server must enforce the decision anyway,
and a second copy of the rule would drift. A composing application informs users through the
existing `ChromeSlots.SessionBanner` and `ChromeSlots.WorkspaceSetupChecklist` slots.

### Amendments

**ADR 0001 gains the `usagePricing` seam.** `composeClientApp()` accepts a second optional
application-provided implementation beside `clientAnalytics`. The rules from ADR 0013 apply:
optional at composition, isolated failures, no default implementation.

**ADR 0002 gains the Usage context.** The current context map now lives in the
[backend architecture guide](../architecture/backend-architecture.md#bounded-contexts), with
`api-contexts.cjs` as its executable source. The table in ADR 0002 remains the map as of its
date. ADR 0002's rule that a context enters the map before its code still applies; this record
is that entry for Usage.

## Consequences

- Upstream gains one context with three packages, four subscribers, three inter-module methods,
  two events, and two routes. A consumer needs only the DTO package.
- The enriched Runners and Workflows events are a prerequisite. Usage subscribers ship in the
  same release as those events, because an event with no subscriber is pruned after seven days.
  Those events are the only reconstruction path. The API server composition test proves the
  Usage module is registered, and operators alert on the Usage subscribers' dispatch backlog well
  before the prune horizon.
- The client shell owns a second optional implementation seam, and usage components carry three
  cost states in their stories and tests.
- Every admission path makes two decisions. The Workflows inter-module contract gains one known
  error, a breaking change under ADR 0002. Trigger history gains a new reason family.
- No upstream package models a consumer's pricing or admission rules.
- `api-contexts.cjs` classifies Usage when its packages land. Until then the file carries a note
  reserving the classification, because the inventory check rejects a path that does not exist.
- This record gates the implementation sequence: the Usage context, the client seam and usage
  views, and the admission seam and its release.

## Rejected alternatives

### A consumer correlates raw lifecycle events itself

**Correlation would live in the wrong place and could not be replayed.** A consumer would depend
on Workflows and Runners internals and lose its input after the seven-day outbox prune. One
correlation, owned upstream and stored durably, serves every consumer.

### Store usage facts in Workflows or Runners

**Neither context owns a metering record.** Workflows owns run orchestration and Runners owns
capacity. A usage record outlives both, carries a long retention, and receives inference segments
from a source outside either context.

### Add aggregate reads to the Usage context

**Aggregates are a different scale problem.** Summary tables, time series, and top-N views need
their own tables, retention, and refresh cadence. Mixing them into the per-entity context would
couple its retention and partitioning to analytics needs.

### Let the client compute amounts from a rates route

**The shell would then own currency, rounding, and the shape of a rate.** Amount formatting and
estimation belong to the implementation that owns prices. The seam keeps the shell neutral and
lets an application change its pricing without an upstream release.

### A run-time client gate

**A client check does not cover external triggers and cannot be trusted.** Webhooks, schedules,
and listeners never pass through the client. The server must decide anyway, and a client copy of
the rule drifts from it.

### One known error per policy reason

**Every new reason would be a breaking change.** ADR 0002 treats a new known error as breaking.
One `admission-denied` code with an open `reason` vocabulary pays that cost once.

### A policy status inside the Workspace operating state

**Workspaces would own an application fact.** Suspension is an administrator decision under
ADR 0008. An application admission rule is a decision that upstream must not model. Two gates
with two owners keep the reasons distinct and the trigger history honest.

### A generic admission policy chain

**One policy object is enough.** A list of policies with ordering rules and result merging is
abstraction without a second consumer. The Runners installation provisioning policy set the
precedent: one optional object, one method, host-owned.
