# Local development and release workflow

This guide owns detailed local-tooling recovery, validation selection, and
package release procedures. It applies after a contributor has completed the
initial setup in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Scripts and task descriptions change with the repository. Read
[mise.toml](../../mise.toml), [package.json](../../package.json), and
[turbo.jsonc](../../turbo.jsonc) for the executable source of truth.

## Choose a local workflow

| When you need to... | Use... |
| --- | --- |
| See available project tasks. | `mise tasks` |
| Run a Node, pnpm, or Turbo command from a non-interactive shell. | `mise exec -- <command>` |
| Run the normal checks for one package and its dependencies. | `mise exec -- turbo <task> --filter=@shipfox/<package>...` |
| Run all affected tasks before a broad change. | `mise exec -- turbo <task> --affected` |
| Start local services in a normal checkout. | `docker compose up -d` |
| Run browser end-to-end coverage. | The [E2E guide](../../e2e/README.md) |

Use the narrowest task that proves the change. A package change normally needs
its package checks, types, and tests. Run broader verification when a changed
contract, shared tool, or dependency can affect other packages.

## Mise and dependencies

`mise.toml` pins the repository toolchain. Run `mise install` after cloning or
when the tool versions change. Use `mise exec --` in scripts and automation so
the command uses the pinned tools.

Install workspace dependencies with:

```sh
mise exec -- pnpm install
```

Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` when the committed lockfile must be
verified without updating it.

If you add, update, or exempt a dependency, read the
[dependency version policy](../policies/dependency-versions.md). It defines
catalog rules, exceptions, package families, and the required dependency
checks.

## Docker services and Conductor worktrees

A normal checkout uses the repository Docker Compose stack:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Conductor workspaces use isolated services. Workspace setup normally starts
them. If setup did not finish or the services need recovery, run:

```sh
mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs up
```

The command leases a worktree-specific 20-port block, starts PostgreSQL,
Temporal, Garage, and Gitea, and writes the app environment to
`.context/local-services/env`. Mise loads that file for later commands.

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Inspect workspace services. | `mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs status` |
| Stop services but keep their data. | `mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs stop` |
| Remove services, volumes, generated state, and the port lease. | `mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs destroy` |
| List stale port leases. | `mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs cleanup` |
| Remove listed stale port leases. | `mise exec -- node dev/worktree-services.mjs cleanup --apply` |

`destroy` is destructive. It removes the worktree Docker volumes and generated
local-service state. It does not stop shared Ollama.

## Shared Ollama

Ollama is a shared service rooted at the main checkout. A Conductor workspace
delegates these tasks to `CONDUCTOR_ROOT_PATH`, so run the same commands from
the workspace or the root checkout.

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Start the server, pull the configured model, and warm it. | `mise run ollama:up` |
| Show endpoint, root, process, and health. | `mise run ollama:status` |
| Stop a server started by this repository. | `mise run ollama:stop` |

The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. The default model and
keep-alive period come from `dev/shared-ollama.mjs`. Set
`SHIPFOX_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `SHIPFOX_OLLAMA_MODEL`, or
`SHIPFOX_OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` only when the local environment requires an
override. Managed state and logs live under
`$CONDUCTOR_ROOT_PATH/.context/shared-ollama/`.

If `ollama:up` reports a live unverified process, stop that process manually
before running the task again. The task will reuse a healthy server and only
stops processes that it can verify as repository-managed.

## Publish packages with Changesets

Published packages live under `libs/` and `tools/`. Apps, end-to-end suites,
and the workspace root are private.

Add a Changeset for a non-trivial pull request that changes a published
package. Documentation-only, formatting-only, and comment-only changes do not
need one. Create it with:

```sh
pnpm exec changeset
```

Choose `patch` for fixes and internal refactors, `minor` for additive public
API, and `major` for breaking public API. Commit the `.changeset/*.md` file
with the change.

Write one concise present-tense summary for each logical change. Keep unrelated
release changes in separate Changesets.

`update-release-pr` runs on `main` and opens or updates the generated release
pull request only when unreleased changesets exist. Its cancelable concurrency
means a newer `main` push supersedes an older pending update; it has no npm
publication authority. `publish-packages` runs only after a merged,
deterministically verified `changeset-release/main` pull request, then checks
out that exact merge revision and publishes under a separate non-cancelable
concurrency group. Do not run `release:publish` as a normal contributor
workflow. It is the workflow command and requires its release environment.

If an npm operation is interrupted or only partly succeeds, use the
`publish-packages` **Run workflow** control with the exact merged release
revision. The publisher re-verifies the generated tree before retrying and its
closure publisher skips versions already present in npm; do not create a new
release PR merely to retry publication.

If a release or package-publishing incident needs tool-specific diagnosis, read
the relevant package documentation under `tools/` and the workflow definition
in [`.github/workflows/publish-packages.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish-packages.yml).
