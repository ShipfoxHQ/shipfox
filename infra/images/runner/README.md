# Shipfox runner image

`@shipfox/runner-image` builds the VM image used by ephemeral Shipfox platform runners. It produces an AWS AMI with Packer's `amazon-ebs` builder and a raw QEMU image from the same provisioning definition. It does not replace `apps/runner/Dockerfile`.

## Build

Builds run the production deploy inside the target VM. This is required because the runner contains architecture-specific native payloads. The wrapper obtains the Node version from `mise`, prunes `@shipfox/runner`, and then invokes Packer.

```sh
BUILD_ARCH=amd64 BUILD_ATTEMPT=1 BUILD_NUMBER=42 BUILD_REVISION=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 pnpm --filter=@shipfox/runner-image image:candidate -- --output /tmp/runner-image-candidate.json
BUILD_ARCH=amd64 BUILD_ATTEMPT=1 BUILD_NUMBER=42 BUILD_RUNNER_VERSION=0.1.0 pnpm --filter=@shipfox/runner-image exec node ./bin/build-runner-image.js ubuntu24 qemu
```

The AMI source uses Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 and requires AWS credentials in `us-east-1`. The QEMU build defaults to a pinned Canonical Ubuntu 24.04 release image and configures its temporary Packer SSH access through a NoCloud seed; the final image locks that bootstrap account. To use a different QEMU source, set both `SHIPFOX_QEMU_SOURCE_IMAGE` and `SHIPFOX_QEMU_SOURCE_CHECKSUM` (for example, `sha256:<digest>`). Relative source paths resolve from the repository root.

Packer is pinned in `mise.toml`. Install QEMU and `xorriso` through the host operating system before running a QEMU build.

## Environment contract

Cloud-init writes `/etc/shipfox/runner.env`. The provider owns the values and must never bake them into the image:

- `SHIPFOX_API_URL`: API base URL.
- `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`: single-use runner registration token.
- `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_LABELS`: comma-separated runner labels.
- `SHIPFOX_POLL_MAX_DURATION_MS`: runner polling deadline. `0` means forever.
- `SHIPFOX_RUNNER_MAX_LIFETIME_SECONDS`: hard instance lifetime. Use a value comfortably above one job's maximum duration.
- `AGENT_CUSTOM_PROVIDER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS=false`: required for cloud runners.

`shipfox-runner.service` powers off immediately when the runner exits. Its SIGTERM drain budget is 90 seconds, after which systemd can force-kill the process and the backend re-reserves the job. `shipfox-max-lifetime.service` schedules a forced poweroff and falls back to a baked 3600-second limit when the configured value is missing or malformed. AWS builds also enable a Spot IMDSv2 watcher that stops the runner, allows it to drain briefly, then powers off.

With `InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior=terminate` and Spot `InstanceInterruptionBehavior=terminate`, provider-side settings convert these poweroffs into EC2 termination. The in-guest watchdog is the fast path. The durable backstop remains tagged-instance reconciliation, the backend staleness reaper, and terminate-on-shutdown because privileged job steps or a wedged kernel can defeat an in-guest timer.

## Recovery drill

On EC2, launch a runner with a short max lifetime, stop the provisioner, and verify the instance terminates before that bound. For Spot, request an interruption notice in a test environment and verify the runner stops claiming work, drains, and powers off before reclaim. These drills feed the EC2 provisioner deployment runbook.

## Candidate builds

After every successful merge to `main`, CI builds one candidate AMI per architecture in the candidate AWS account. Candidates are not releases: CI does not publish a catalog, set a latest pointer, or record a release version.

The candidate command writes its AMI ID, architecture, region, source SHA, and whether it built or reused the image to its required `--output` JSON file. The AMI tags are the discovery contract. Internal users resolve an available image by its exact source SHA and architecture with `shipfox.managed=true`, `shipfox.lifecycle=candidate`, `shipfox.revision`, and `shipfox.architecture`. Candidates also record their GitHub build metadata and an expiry timestamp for account-level cleanup.

CI assumes `AWS_RUNNER_IMAGE_CANDIDATE_ROLE_ARN` through GitHub OIDC. The role must belong to the candidate account and trust only `ShipfoxHQ/shipfox` builds from `main`. Candidate AMIs must not be used by production provisioning.

QEMU output is test-only and is not published as a distributed artifact. The supported consumer path is a local or CI build followed by a boot test:

```sh
BUILD_ARCH=amd64 BUILD_ATTEMPT=1 BUILD_NUMBER=42 BUILD_RUNNER_VERSION=0.1.0 pnpm --filter=@shipfox/runner-image exec node ./bin/build-runner-image.js ubuntu24 qemu
```

The automated QEMU boot and watchdog suite is tracked in ENG-1022.
