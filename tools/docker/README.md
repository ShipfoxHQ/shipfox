# @shipfox/docker

Workspace wrapper around `docker buildx` for building Shipfox app images. It prepares the build context and runs a single multi-platform build, so adding a new app image is a one-file change. It should be used with other packages from [Shipfox](https://www.shipfox.io/).

## What it does

- **`shipfox-docker`**: Runs `docker buildx build` for the current package, with sensible defaults driven by the environment.
- **Context prep (`--setup-context`)**: Runs `turbo prune --docker` into an `out/` directory under the package and overlays each pruned package's prebuilt `dist/` into `out/full/`. This is the "build outside Docker, ingest `dist`" approach: the image never recompiles TypeScript, it ingests the turbo-cached build plus a real `node_modules`.
- **Per-commit tags (`--image <name>`)**: Assembles the tag set from the environment so one `turbo image --filter …` tags every app. The CI workflow supplies the _ref_ (registry bases as `IMAGE_REGISTRIES` and the commit identity as `GITHUB_SHA` / `BUILD_NUMBER` / `GITHUB_REF_NAME`) and the package script passes the image name. For each base it emits `<base>/<name>:sha-<short>`, `:build-<number>`, and a moving branch tag: the default branch (`main`) becomes `:latest`, any other branch its sanitized name. With `IMAGE_REGISTRIES` unset it emits one `<name>:ci` tag for validation builds. An explicit `--tag` you pass takes precedence and skips derivation.
- **Push vs. validate by registry**: with `IMAGE_REGISTRIES` set it builds `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push`, emitting the multi-arch manifest in one invocation (no per-arch tags, no `docker manifest` step; QEMU covers both arches). With `--image` but no registry it builds single-arch `--platform linux/amd64`; local runs use `--load`, while GitHub Actions validation uses `--output=type=cacheonly` and pushes nothing.
- **OCI build metadata**: sets `--build-arg IMAGE_REVISION` (from `GITHUB_SHA`) and `--build-arg IMAGE_CREATED` (the build time) for the app images. These are passed by the tool, not as `turbo image -- …` args, because anything after `--` enters the hash of every task in the run, so a run-unique timestamp would bust the workspace build cache.
- **Clean manifest**: Defaults to `--provenance=false` so the pushed multi-arch index stays a clean per-arch manifest, without the `unknown/unknown` provenance entries some registries display. Pass your own `--provenance` to re-enable SLSA attestations.
- **gha BuildKit cache**: Adds `--cache-from`/`--cache-to type=gha` (scoped per image) when running in GitHub Actions.

Every default is added only when you did not pass the flag yourself, so the caller stays in control (e.g. pass your own `--platform`, `--push`/`--load`, or `--build-arg` to override).

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add -D @shipfox/docker
```

> [!NOTE]
> `shipfox-docker` calls `docker buildx`, so you need the Docker CLI with Buildx. A multi-arch build also needs QEMU. In CI, `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `docker/setup-buildx-action` set both up.

## Usage

Add an `image` script to the app's `package.json`. It passes the registry image name; the workflow supplies the registries and commit identity through the environment, so the tags are assembled at build time:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "image": "shipfox-docker --setup-context --image api"
  }
}
```

Static apps (no `node_modules`) skip context prep and ingest a prebuilt artifact:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "image": "shipfox-docker --image client"
  }
}
```

You can still pass `--tag` explicitly (e.g. for a one-off local build); doing so skips the env-based derivation entirely.

### Environment

- `IMAGE_REGISTRIES` — space-separated registry bases for the derived tags (e.g. `ghcr.io/shipfoxhq docker.io/shipfoxhq`). Each base produces its own tag set; unset means the PR validation path (one local `<name>:ci` tag, no push). Read by name, so a credential variable is never mistaken for a registry.
- `GITHUB_SHA` / `BUILD_NUMBER` / `GITHUB_REF_NAME` — the commit identity for the `sha-<short>`, `build-<number>`, and moving branch tags. The moving tag is `latest` on the default branch (`main`) and the sanitized branch name otherwise. `GITHUB_SHA` also becomes the `IMAGE_REVISION` build-arg.
- `NODE_VERSION` / `PNPM_VERSION` — forwarded as `--build-arg` for the base image.
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS` — enables the gha BuildKit cache.
- `npm_package_name` — the prune target for `--setup-context` (set by the package manager when run through a script).
