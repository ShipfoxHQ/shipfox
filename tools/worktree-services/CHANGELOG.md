# @shipfox/worktree-services

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 280260c: Worktree leases are 25 ports instead of 20, and `discordApi` moves to offset 20 so it no longer shares a port with the E2E registry. A lease from a 20-port block is replaced with a 25-port block the next time services start, so its ports change.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- b416c4c: Preserves existing package behavior while simplifying internal control flow.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 9f898d9: Replaces the logs-only `LOG_STORAGE_S3_*` base configuration with shared `OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_*` settings, per-consumer prefixes, and optional overrides, and adds encrypted agent-session transcript persistence. Self-hosters must migrate their S3 settings and provide `AGENT_SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEK`; the DTO packages receive matching major versions for the API package-family release without DTO schema changes.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f78740d: Remove Unicode dash punctuation from package prose and source comments.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5644381: Publish reusable worktree service lifecycle tooling for root checkouts and Conductor workspaces.
