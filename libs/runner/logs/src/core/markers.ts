 * mid-line or after whitespace is plain text. `::endgroup::` must match exactly, so a
 * trailing argument (`::endgroup:: x`) is not a marker. The name is returned verbatim;
 * secret masking and the DTO's byte cap are applied downstream (the transform masks it, the
 * framer truncates it), so this stays a pure, side-effect-free parser.
