 * Tails a growing append-only JSONL file by byte offset and forwards each complete line.
 *
 * pi persists each session entry synchronously (appendFileSync) and may defer the first write
 * until the first assistant message, then bulk-write several lines at once — a byte-offset
 * reader handles both, where a line-index reader would not. A poll can observe a partial write
 * (a large entry spans several write() syscalls), so the carry buffer holds raw bytes, not a
 * decoded string: bytes are split on the newline and only whole lines are decoded, so a read
 * that ends mid-codepoint never turns the split character into U+FFFD.
 *
 * Capture is best-effort: a missing file (not yet written, or removed on workspace cleanup)
 * or a read error stops forwarding quietly without ever throwing into the caller.
