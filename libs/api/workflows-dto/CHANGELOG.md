### Patch Changes

- @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@24.1.1

## 24.1.0

### Minor Changes

- @shipfox/api-agent-dto@24.0.0

## 23.0.0

### Minor Changes

- bd5acd2: Bounds listener filter snapshots to referenced context paths and a separate 512 KiB `filter_snapshot` execution payload limit.

## 22.0.0

### Major Changes

- e390533: Removes the legacy `GET /workflows/runs/:id` detail route.
  It removes `workflowRunDetailResponseSchema`, `jobDtoSchema`, `jobExecutionDtoSchema`, and their public exports, including `workflowRunJobDetailDtoSchema`, `workflowRunJobExecutionDetailDtoSchema`, `workflowRunStepDetailDtoSchema`, `WorkflowRunJobDetailDto`, `WorkflowRunJobExecutionDetailDto`, and `WorkflowRunStepDetailDto`.
  It also removes `WORKFLOW_RUN_DETAIL_REQUEST_KIND_HEADER`, `WORKFLOW_RUN_DETAIL_REQUEST_KINDS`, `WorkflowRunDetailRequestKind`, `getWorkflowRunDetail`, `useWorkflowRunQuery`, `workflowRunQueryOptions`, and `WorkflowRunDetail` exports.
  Run-attempt lists now return `{items, next_cursor}` with a default limit of 25; run lists omit trigger payloads, inputs, and source snapshots.
  Run-list and job-detail display statuses now use API-provided bounded status fields.
  Consumers must migrate to bounded overviews, paginated job and attempt resources, and dedicated job or step-attempt detail reads.
  Direct HTTP consumers of the removed detail route receive 404 responses without a compatibility signal.

### Minor Changes

- c392dfb: Adds typed synthetic listener dispatch and shared payload limits for production-shaped E2E coverage.

## 21.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f2c634: Adds bounded workflow execution trigger-event list and detail reads with stable
  pagination and size-limited payload previews. Existing execution context reads
  continue to support historical executions.
- 12cc22e: Adds bounded Agent Access tools for workflow execution trigger-event diagnostics.

### Patch Changes

- 8407bd1: Rejects oversized listener fire deliveries without suppressing matching resolve events.
  - @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@21.2.0

## 21.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 01af160: Separates execution payload limits from diagnostic read limits and bounds oversized workflow failures.
- 8a98a87: Bounds workflow step-attempt detail responses and adds typed oversized-field reasons to step-attempt diagnostics.
- 6fac62f: Adds runner identity to the `runners.job.claimed` projection on `job_executions`, and adds `workspaceId`, `projectId`, `definitionId`, `jobKey`, `queuedAt`, `startedAt`, and runner identity to `workflows.job_execution.terminated` and `jobKey`, `definitionId`, and `runNumber` to `workflows.job_execution.queued`, so a consumer can build a complete usage record from a single event.

### Patch Changes

  - @shipfox/api-agent-dto@21.1.0

## 21.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 12f7b10: Exposes bounded workflow-run diagnostics through the Workflows inter-module contract.
- cffa62d: Adds bounded workflow-run overviews with API-provided status, duration, and
  `has_started_job_execution`, plus pinned-attempt workspace navigation and
  attempt/source reads.
- b5d02d1: Adds renewable inference credential metadata, capability, and failure-reason contracts while preserving legacy behavior.

## 20.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a66057: Adds lazy source, execution-context, and step-diagnostic workflow APIs with bounded diagnostic reads and writes.

## 20.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 813a284: Adds CEL `dyn` support for unknown-shaped tool and JSON outputs, preserves their native runtime values, and keeps listener snapshots compatible during rolling deploys.

## 20.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ff63dcd: Adds the workflow-run annotations endpoint with job, execution, and step ancestry, plus the job-explanations endpoint for failed or skipped jobs without execution rows.
- 61f7b94: Adds bounded selected-job detail and cursor-paginated execution, step, and step-attempt API responses, and caps persisted error and gate text in workflow-run responses.

### Patch Changes

  - @shipfox/annotations-dto@20.2.0
  - @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@20.2.0

## 20.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6207ce3: Adds bounded workflow run overview and job-page APIs with capped execution counts and source-snapshot enforcement.
- 5efaf93: Allow workflow run detail URLs to resolve a single run selection from a deeply nested attempt, job, execution, or step ID without requiring the intermediate ancestry in the URL.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3ec04b0]
  - @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@20.1.0
  - @shipfox/api-agent-dto@20.1.0

## 20.0.0

### Minor Changes

- fdfa0b2: Add the `WORKFLOW_RUN_DETAIL_REQUEST_KIND_HEADER` request-kind header and `WorkflowRunDetailRequestKind` type for workflow-run detail reads; client-workflows detail requests now send the request kind, which the API records as initial versus polling.
- af4a765: Add the workflow-run lineage head endpoint and opt-in cursor pagination for attempt history while preserving the legacy no-query response.
- 70f2eed: Adds checkout credential renewal to the setup checkout-token response via `refresh-at`/`on-rejection` renewal modes and accepts an optional `rejected_generation` when renewing.

### Patch Changes

- @shipfox/api-agent-dto@20.0.0
- @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@20.0.0

## 19.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 34ebe6a: Expose workspace-scoped workflow execution and annotation read contracts.
- 93918a4: Server workflow tool steps now return a `wait` protocol while a scheduled tool call is pending, and clients recognize the new `tool_error`, `tool_config_invalid`, and `invocation_interrupted` step error reasons.

  - @shipfox/inter-module@0.2.3

## 18.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 151f750: Claims agent sessions at step dispatch and carries the session descriptor:
  - Resolves the session key template at the step-dispatch context site with the same roots as the prompt and calls the agent-module `claimSession` before the step is handed to the runner. A `resume` claim that conflicts with a live attempt, a resolved harness that differs from the session's pinned harness, an invalid resolved key, or an unavailable session registry fails the attempt through the config-evaluation-failure path with one of the new step error reasons: `agent_session_key_invalid`, `agent_session_held`, `agent_session_harness_mismatch`, `agent_session_unavailable`.
  - Embeds the resolved session descriptor `{id, key, mode, segment}` in the step dispatch config and exposes it as a typed nullable `session` field on the step DTO; the attempt config records the descriptor for the UI and audits.

- b2aad90: Adds `generation` and `renewal` checkout-credential fields and `createCheckoutCredentials`, which accepts the frozen connection, stable repository ID, exact permissions, and rejected generation.
- a50e2dc: Expose the `cancellation_reason` field so consumers can distinguish user cancellation from maximum-duration timeouts.

### Patch Changes

- 242bd21: Classifies infrastructure step errors consistently across API and client workflows.
- Updated dependencies [a6f242c]

## 17.1.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [fd6cee5]
  - @shipfox/api-agent-dto@17.1.0

## 17.0.0

### Minor Changes

- ed4981e: Adds the lease-authed agent session transcript transport: `GET /runs/jobs/current/steps/:stepId/session` returns the decrypted, still-gzipped head snapshot with manifest headers (or a 204 no-head marker), and `POST .../session?attempt=N&base_segment=S` commits segment `S + 1` under the claim/base CAS with idempotent-retry acks and 409 conflicts. The routes resolve the leased step through a new workflows inter-module method (`getLeasedAgentSessionContext`); the artifact store enforces the session blob cap.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [be5fb95]
  - @shipfox/api-agent-dto@17.0.0
  - @shipfox/api-definitions-dto@17.0.0

## 16.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d1fb0a3: Adds the agent session claim and carry-over inter-module methods (`claimSession`, `carryOverSessions`) with the session descriptor (`id`, `key`, `mode`, `segment`), so workflows can resume or fork a session and rerun attempts can carry sessions forward.

  Session claims are released automatically on step-attempt and job termination, with a stale-claim reap cron as a backstop.

  The previously required `jobLeaseTokenTtlSeconds` option on `createAgentModule` is removed; pass an optional `workflows` client to enable the job-terminated grace sweep.

### Patch Changes

- 870523f: Adds the tool step model: a `kind: 'tool'` step in the `definitions-dto` step union (snapshot version 3) carrying `tool`, `connection`, `with`, `outputMappings`, and `templates`, with sync-time validation (`missing-connection-for-tool`, `integration-connection-not-found` / `-not-capable`, `unknown-integration-tool`, `tool-input-invalid`, `tool-input-unknown-key`). `@shipfox/api-workflows` and `@shipfox/api-workflows-dto` add the tool step to the run-graph step type union and its display name. The workflow document parser still rejects tool-step fields, so nothing is user-authorable yet.

## 15.0.0

### Minor Changes

- af095a4: Adds the `startDevRun` inter-module method that creates a workflow run from an inline model and snapshot with `origin: 'dev'` and dev provenance, numbered by the workflow lineage id. Manual `subscriptionId` and cron `scheduleId` trigger payload fields become optional so a dev trigger can fire without a subscription row.

## 14.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f30864: Trigger `event` is now optional end to end. An omitted event subscribes to every event from its source. Explicit events continue to work unchanged. Built-in manual and scheduled triggers use `fire` and `tick`, respectively.
- b766ee3: Adds `origin` and `dev_source` to workflow runs, with an `origin` facet on the run list and aggregates endpoints. Existing runs read as `synced`. Dev runs check out their pinned source commit by default, while same-project replay event commits retain precedence.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [09924ca]
  - @shipfox/api-agent-dto@14.0.0

## 13.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d3c2e3: Updates @shipfox/client-agent, @shipfox/client-onboarding, and @shipfox/client-workflows to show
  managed inference providers without exposing workspace credential setup, keep workflow examples
  limited to supported models, and explain managed-provider failures in workflow runs.

## 13.0.0

### Major Changes

- af6b31e: Expose ordered queued and terminal workflow job-execution facts, and release terminal runner reservations once no uncancelled lease remains.

## 12.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4df5e37: Workflow run list items and run detail now carry `has_started_job_execution`, reporting whether any
  job execution of the attempt reached a runner. Run surfaces no longer show a client-derived `Queued`
  state: the run list and run detail present the API attempt status and duration, and read the new
  field to label a finished run's duration as run or elapsed time.

## 12.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 53b87f0: Distinguish queued and executing jobs in workflow run list status strips.

## 12.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b1838c: Expose actionable status reasons and messages when materialized job outputs cannot be persisted.

## 12.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4b0731e: Adds workflow troubleshooting details, evaluation traces, failure annotations, runner context, step output metadata, and lazy paginated annotation summaries.

## 12.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ce0984d: Preserve structured values when jobs map typed step outputs, normalize them for JSON persistence, and bound materialized job output sizes and entry counts.

### Patch Changes

- @shipfox/api-agent-dto@12.2.0

## 12.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 312a137: Add typed step errors for invalid checkout paths and occupied checkout destinations.

## 12.0.0

### Major Changes

- adf07e7: Cut over workflow and job display names to literal-only `name` fields, with runtime interpolation supported through `run_name` and `execution_name`.
- 54c820e: Add the trigger reference and the current attempt's jobs to each workflow run in the run list response.

  `trigger_reference` carries the repository, ref, commit, and actor a source-control trigger resolved, or null for triggers that resolve none. Jobs arrive as `jobs`, a preview bounded by the new `WORKFLOW_RUN_JOB_PREVIEW_LIMIT`, alongside `job_status_counts` covering every job of the attempt including those past the preview.

- 032d316: Scope checkout credential minting to the currently running checkout step and return its fetch depth.

### Minor Changes

- ee2ce67: Accept a `${{ }}` interpolation in an agent step's `thinking` field. The schema
  still offers the per-harness enum for editor completion, and the dispatcher
  checks the resolved value against the harness levels. An unsupported
  resolved level fails the step.
- f7939c7: Add resolved checkout details as a dedicated step-report field.
- dea1ffd: Expose normalized repository references on listening execution events.
- 285fff2: Persist resolved workflow job execution names and handle dynamic naming failures consistently.
- e44a279: Persist nullable resolved workflow run-name overrides alongside static workflow-name snapshots.
- 35a42bd: Resolve run and agent step working directories against the runner job workspace.
- d77baaa: Add per-definition sequential numbers to workflow runs and expose them in the API and expression context.
- c2a8e54: Normalize checkout target fields for step-dispatch resolution, reject unsupported job-level checkout fields, and keep the workflow model and runtime checkout contracts aligned.
- cb0abfa: Expose the normalized trigger project, repository, ref, and commit in workflow context.

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b0d344: Publishes the complete API runtime closure with packed-consumer-safe internal imports and records its exact package set in application releases.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c18360: Durable gate restart: a failing gate's `on_failure.restart_from` now records the failed attempt, rewinds the job's step projection from the named earlier step back to pending (opening fresh attempts), and leaves the job running so it re-executes from there — all in one transaction with the report. A per-step attempt cap (default 3) bounds restart loops, exhausting to a `restart_exhausted` failure. Adds the `workflows.step.restart_enqueued` event.
- 7a9943d: Adds the backend contract for per-step execution: job claims mint a lease token for the step API, step reports carry attempts and exit codes, and workflow completion can be signalled through the workflows outbox. The runner-side step loop is intentionally owned by the follow-up runner protocol work.
- 736249b: Expose step attempts in the read API: the run-detail endpoint now returns `current_attempt` on each step plus its per-attempt history (`attempts[]`, with status, exit code, gate result and restart reason), so a restarted step's attempts are visible.
- 2bc5595: Adds workflow-run cancellation across the API, orchestration queue cleanup, event contract, and run-page cancel action.
- 940696a: Adds the credential-free checkout intent type and a checkout-token response DTO (basic/bearer auth with a validated expiry) to the Orchestration DTO package, establishing the contract for runner-managed repository checkouts over the lease-scoped checkout flow.
- e9396c9: Give every runner-dispatched job a synthetic "Set up job" step at position 0 (à la GitHub Actions), so failures that happen around the user steps — workspace preparation today, the repository checkout next — are reported through the existing per-step protocol instead of hanging the job until the lease/timeout fires. The runner prepares the per-job workspace inside this step and reports the outcome; a failed setup flows through the existing fail-job cascade, finalizing the job `failed` in seconds with no user step run.

  Extends `stepErrorDtoSchema` with an optional machine-readable `reason` (`workspace_prep_failed`, `git_unavailable`, `checkout_*`, `setup_aborted`) and a `category` (`setup` | `user`). The runner reports `reason`; the server derives `category` from the step type on read (the runner is an untrusted boundary). The restart resolver now skips the synthetic step so a user step named "Set up job" can never rewind setup mid-job.

- 3afb7e3: Adds job execution success expressions and execution timeouts to workflow documents.
  Renames job execution IDs in auth, runner, workflow, and timeout event contracts to the explicit `jobExecutionId` / `job_execution_id` shape.
- c652a68: Add a single reliable job-terminal event: `workflows.job.terminated` is now written in the same transaction as every terminal job-status flip (normal completion, DAG cancellation, lease-expiry resolution, and timeout), and the run-level `workflows.workflow_run.terminated` is emitted the same way. All workflows event names are aligned on one `WORKFLOWS_<entity>_<verb>` scheme, so the run and job terminal events read as the same event at two scopes.

  Internal breaking change (`WORKFLOWS_JOB_COMPLETED` → `WORKFLOWS_JOB_STEPS_SETTLED`, `WORKFLOW_RUN_*` → `WORKFLOWS_WORKFLOW_RUN_*`, with matching DTO type renames) consumed only within this monorepo.

- c0a883c: Adds the runner-facing per-step endpoints (`POST /runs/jobs/current/steps/next` and `/steps/:stepId/report`) authed by a locally-verified job lease token, with the matching request/response schemas.
- d69b164: Adds workflow run attempt lineage APIs and a run summary switcher for navigating rerun attempts.
- e699508: Adds first-class skipped workflow jobs with persisted status reasons across API DTOs, orchestration, events, and client run views.

### Patch Changes

- eb40964: Add an inline `agent` workflow step that the runner runs with the pi harness. A step is an agent step when it carries `model` + `prompt` and no `run`; it takes a free-text `model`, a single `prompt`, and an optional `thinking` level (default `high`). The step runs to process-success (the agent ran to completion) and reports through the existing step protocol with no runner/backend protocol change, so change quality is judged by a downstream `run` + `gate` step. v1 does not persist the agent's work (no diff, commit, or PR).
- c17dd6e: Adds run-step output emission through `$SHIPFOX_OUTPUT` with runner-side parsing, caps, masking, and report plumbing.
- f98c2be: [api/workflows] Add the lease-authed `POST /runs/jobs/current/checkout-token` endpoint. The runner exchanges its job lease for short-lived, read-only repository checkout credentials. The job's checkout intent is resolved server-side from the authoritative `jobId` claim (`job -> run -> project` source metadata) and minted on demand via the integration service's `createCheckoutSpec()`; no credential material is ever stored on the job/run or queued. `checkoutTokenResponseSchema.auth` stays optional so credential-free providers can return a public clone URL with no token, and `integrationRouteErrorHandler` is exported from `@shipfox/api-integration-core` so the route reuses the shared provider-error mapping.
- b525dcd: Let an agent workflow step pick its pi provider with an optional free-text `provider` field (default `anthropic`), threaded to the runner's pi model lookup, and split agent-step failures into a user-fixable `agent_config_invalid` reason (unknown provider, missing runner credentials, wrong provider/model pair) versus `agent_invocation_failed` for genuine provider/API errors.
- 795f440: Adds the listener orchestration loop for long-lived listening jobs: durable event draining, one execution per buffered event, resolution on until, listening deadline, or max executions, and a run-timeout backstop that resolves active listeners.
- 3dcd751: Adds listener filter snapshots to job activation events and persists them on listener subscriptions.
- 362b3eb: Scope runner log append authorization to the dispatched step attempt carried by the job lease token.
- 2fb3e87: Derives workflow run attempt durations on the client and displays them in the run list and run header.
- ef1e917: Adds listening-job authoring fields and trusted execution context validation for listening jobs.
  Separates workflow identifiers so internal rows use UUID `id`, authored workflow/job/step
  references use `key`, and UI labels use `name`.
- 2933c33: Adds drain-boundary Zod validation for current outbox publisher event payloads.
- 8ecc121: Track queue/run/finish timing for workflow runs and jobs. Adds nullable `started_at`/`finished_at` to workflow runs and `queued_at`/`started_at`/`finished_at` to jobs, exposed on the run and job DTOs. The runners module emits two new authoritative-timestamp events (`runners.job.queued`, `runners.job.started`) in the same transaction as the enqueue/claim; workflows projects them onto the job row with a first-write-wins `coalesce`, so the at-least-once outbox can redeliver out of order safely. Run `started_at`/`finished_at` and job `finished_at` are stamped in-module at the status transitions. All columns are nullable and eventually consistent, so consumers must treat a missing endpoint as "not yet known" and clamp any duration math.
