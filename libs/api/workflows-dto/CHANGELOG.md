## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c18360: Durable gate restart: a failing gate's `on_failure.restart_from` now records the failed attempt, rewinds the job's step projection from the named earlier step back to pending (opening fresh attempts), and leaves the job running so it re-executes from there — all in one transaction with the report. A per-step attempt cap (default 3) bounds restart loops, exhausting to a `restart_exhausted` failure. Adds the `workflows.step.restart_enqueued` event.
- 7a9943d: Adds the backend contract for per-step execution: job claims mint a lease token for the step API, step reports carry attempts and exit codes, and workflow completion can be signalled through the workflows outbox. The runner-side step loop is intentionally owned by the follow-up runner protocol work.
- 736249b: Expose step attempts in the read API: the run-detail endpoint now returns `current_attempt` on each step plus its per-attempt history (`attempts[]`, with status, exit code, gate result and restart reason), so a restarted step's attempts are visible.
- 940696a: Adds the credential-free checkout intent type and a checkout-token response DTO (basic/bearer auth with a validated expiry) to the Orchestration DTO package, establishing the contract for runner-managed repository checkouts over the lease-scoped checkout flow.
- c0a883c: Adds the runner-facing per-step endpoints (`POST /runs/jobs/current/steps/next` and `/steps/:stepId/report`) authed by a locally-verified job lease token, with the matching request/response schemas.
