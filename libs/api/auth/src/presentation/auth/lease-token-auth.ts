/**
 * Trust boundary: the signed token is the sole authority — `claims.jobId` scopes
 * every runner request to exactly one job. `workflowRunAttemptId`/`workspaceId` are carried for
 * consumers but are NOT verified against the database here.
 *
 * Revocation tradeoff: `runnerSessionId` is carried in the claims but is not checked
 * against runner-session storage, so a lease minted before its registration token is
 * revoked stays usable until it expires (`AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`, 90m).
 * Accepted deliberately for a short-lived, job-scoped capability token; tightening
 * this would mean a per-request DB lookup on the hot status-reporting path. See the
 * "Security model" section in the package README for the full rationale.
