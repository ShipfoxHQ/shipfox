# @shipfox/api-auth-dto

## 24.0.0

### Minor Changes

- a43b3c5: Adds impersonation window command and read contracts plus `AUTH_IMPERSONATION_WINDOW_MAX`; when impersonation is enabled, `@shipfox/api-auth` rejects JWT lifetimes below one minute at startup.

## 23.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [a5c2ebd]
  - @shipfox/api-common-dto@23.2.0

## 23.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7fed218: Activates Agent Access OAuth, MCP tools, and settings in the default application composition.

  `API_PUBLIC_URL` is required. Set it to the externally reachable API origin
  before startup. Local development may use `http://localhost:16101`; staging and
  production must use HTTPS.

  The `apiPublicUrl` option of `createAgentAccessRoutes` and
  `createAgentAccessModule` now accepts only a bare HTTPS origin or a loopback
  HTTP origin. Construction rejects paths, queries, fragments, credentials,
  surrounding whitespace, control characters, and non-loopback HTTP origins.

  OAuth consent responses now distinguish CIMD identities from self-registered
  clients. API DTO consumers must use `client_identity_kind`;
  `client_identity_origin` is an origin for CIMD clients and `null` for
  self-registered clients. In `@shipfox/client-agent`, `OAuthConsent` replaces
  `clientIdentityOrigin` with the `clientIdentity` discriminated union; use
  `clientIdentity.kind` and, for CIMD identities, `clientIdentity.origin`.

  Applications that previously appended `createOAuthRoutes`,
  `createOAuthAuthorizationRoutes`, or `createAgentAccessManagementRoutes` to
  `createAuthModule().routes` must remove those manual route groups. The standard
  module composition now registers them, and composing them twice causes duplicate
  Fastify route registration.

  Applications that replace the standard Auth module with `authModuleFactory`
  must register `AUTH_AGENT_ACCESS`. Include the `createAgentAccessAuthMethod`
  export from `@shipfox/api-auth` in the replacement module's auth methods so the
  default MCP route can authenticate agent-access credentials.

  After deployment, fetch
  `$API_PUBLIC_URL/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and verify that its
  issuer and endpoint origins match `API_PUBLIC_URL`.

### Minor Changes

- 5ae8b3d: Adds `sessionResponseSchema` and `SessionResponseDto`, the adopted-session mint and renewal response contract carrying the optional `impersonator_id`.
- 918d84a: Adds the impersonation mint command and admin route: `POST /admin/auth/users/:user_id/impersonate` mints a short-lived, marked, audited impersonated session for an active, verified, non-administrator user, gated behind the opt-in `AUTH_IMPERSONATION_ENABLED` flag (defaults to `false`). The response DTO `impersonateResponseSchema` carries `token`, `expires_at`, `server_time`, `impersonator_id`, and the target user.

### Patch Changes

- 4a91956: Publishes a shared provider-neutral `emailSchema` in `@shipfox/api-common-dto` and adopts it across auth and workspace invitation inputs.

Extends the packed external consumer gate to exercise both seams against PostgreSQL through installed tarballs.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d02c5fd: Queues auth and workspace transactional emails through module-owned outbox events so account verification, password reset, and invitation sends retry outside request transactions.
- c0a883c: Moves the job lease capability token codec and its claims schema from the runners packages into api-auth/api-auth-dto, renaming its config to `AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_*`, so all signed-token codecs live with authentication. Adds a shared leased-job auth context for request-scoped lease claims, and a shared `createLeaseTokenAuthMethod` (the `leased-job` auth method) registered on the auth module so any feature module can protect routes with a lease token by name.
- 3afb7e3: Adds job execution success expressions and execution timeouts to workflow documents.
  Renames job execution IDs in auth, runner, workflow, and timeout event contracts to the explicit `jobExecutionId` / `job_execution_id` shape.
- 6181819: Adds runner registration sessions with bounded label contracts, session-token auth, and lease-token heartbeat ownership.

### Patch Changes

- e250c4c: Propagates `projectId` end-to-end into the job lease token. Workflows sources the `{workspaceId, projectId, workflowRunId, workflowRunAttemptId, jobId, jobExecutionId}` identity tuple and threads it through the runner pending/running job tables and lease claims. This is lease-shape groundwork for per-project log-ingest authorization; the stream-stamping consumer lands separately.
- 362b3eb: Scope runner log append authorization to the dispatched step attempt carried by the job lease token.
- 27770eb: Tightens signup, workspace, and project display-name validation with shared trimming, control and format-character rejection, length limits, and contextual client form errors.
- Updated dependencies [27770eb]
  - @shipfox/api-common-dto@0.1.0
