- 3ddde91: Adds the secrets and variables management API with DTO contracts, exact-scope storage helpers, outbox events, and workspace-admin route guards.

### Patch Changes

- f66f606: Test suites can create managed secrets and variables through protected setup APIs.
- e51d464: Add the Secrets & Variables workspace settings UI (S1b).
  - New `@shipfox/client-secrets` package: transport + React Query hooks (a shared
    `createStoreApi` factory), a write-only secret form and a readable variable form
    (TanStack Form + Zod, multiline `Textarea` values, live short-value / sensitive-name
    advisories), and the workspace secrets/variables sections (single-call list, masked
    secret values, copy-name, delete with blast-radius warning).
  - `@shipfox/client-workspace-settings`: new Secrets and Variables settings pages and nav
    entries.
  - `@shipfox/api-secrets-dto`: export `SECRETS_MAX_LIST_LIMIT` and raise the list `limit`
    cap so the settings UI can fetch the whole bounded set in one request; the variable
    list item now carries `value_truncated`.
  - `@shipfox/api-secrets`: the variable list returns a bounded single-line preview of each
    value (the full value is read via `GET /variables/:key` when editing) so a single-call
    list cannot materialize very large responses; startup fails if `SECRETS_MAX_PER_WORKSPACE`
    exceeds the list limit.
  - `@shipfox/client-router`: register the `/workspaces/$wid/settings/secrets` and
    `/variables` routes.
