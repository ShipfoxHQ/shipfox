## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 59ba68b: Integrates workflow definitions with accepted workflow documents and normalized workflow models.
- 7fa8f0b: Fix VCS sync failing when a manual definition shares a config_path. The
  `definitions_wd_project_id_config_path_unique` index was source-agnostic, so a
  manual (or validated) definition and a ref/sha-keyed VCS definition at the same
  `config_path` collided on an index that was not the VCS upsert's `ON CONFLICT`
  arbiter, raising an unhandled unique violation and breaking sync. The index (and
  the manual upsert predicate) is now scoped to manual rows so the two coexist.

  A CHECK constraint and request validation now bind `source` to its git
  coordinates (vcs rows carry a ref or sha; manual rows carry neither), so the
  index predicate's correctness is enforced rather than incidental.

- 9a5aac4: Adds cron trigger schedule and timezone fields with source-specific document validation.
- 61de795: Adds canonical runner label validation and default runner label fallback for workflow definition parsing.
- 2933c33: Adds drain-boundary Zod validation for current outbox publisher event payloads.
- b8919da: Removes the unused workflow-spec, job, and step schemas now that `@shipfox/workflow-document` owns workflow document parsing, keeping only the still-used `TriggerDto` type.
