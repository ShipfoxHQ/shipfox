 * Releases every session claim the terminated step attempt held. Guarded on

 * never steal a claim another attempt just took. Events written before the
 * `stepAttemptId` field existed carry no identity; those claims are left for
 * the job-terminated grace sweep and the reap cron.
 *
 * The release is delivered asynchronously through the workflows outbox, so it
 * is not ordered against the next synchronous `claimSession` at dispatch: the
 * dispatch side reconciles terminal holders through a guarded release before
 * retrying the claim.
