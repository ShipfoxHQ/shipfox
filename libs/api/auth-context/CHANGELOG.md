# @shipfox/api-auth-context

## 2.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b0d344: Publishes the complete API runtime closure with packed-consumer-safe internal imports and records its exact package set in application releases.

### Patch Changes

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a81b68c: Adds provisioner token and auth context primitives for workspace-scoped control-plane credentials.
- c0a883c: Moves the job lease capability token codec and its claims schema from the runners packages into api-auth/api-auth-dto, renaming its config to `AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_*`, so all signed-token codecs live with authentication. Adds a shared leased-job auth context for request-scoped lease claims, and a shared `createLeaseTokenAuthMethod` (the `leased-job` auth method) registered on the auth module so any feature module can protect routes with a lease token by name.
- 6181819: Adds runner registration sessions with bounded label contracts, session-token auth, and lease-token heartbeat ownership.

### Patch Changes

- 72ce351: Removes the legacy workspace API-key auth surface, its DTOs, project-access branch, database table, and token prefix support.
- 82d22e4: Make the workspace-membership gate stateless. `requireWorkspaceAccess` now lives in `@shipfox/api-auth-context` and authorizes a request purely from the verified session-token claims, replacing the `requireMembership` gate in `@shipfox/api-workspaces` that read the workspace row from the database on every workspace-scoped request. Membership and role already travel in the token, so the check needs no database access.

  This removes the per-request database read and severs the runtime dependency on `@shipfox/api-workspaces` from feature modules that only needed the membership gate (integration providers, secrets, projects, agent, runners). Workspace existence and `active`-status enforcement, which no code path currently exercises, moves off the hot path; enforce it at token issuance when workspace suspension is introduced.
