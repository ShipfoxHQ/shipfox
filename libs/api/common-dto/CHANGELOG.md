# @shipfox/api-common-dto

## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a91956: Publishes a shared provider-neutral `emailSchema` in `@shipfox/api-common-dto` and adopts it across auth and workspace invitation inputs. Adds a read-only `findUserByEmail`/`EmailOwner` seam to `@shipfox/api-auth` for looking up the current owner of a normalized email without creating a session or mutating that user. Extends the packed external consumer gate to exercise both seams against PostgreSQL through installed tarballs.
