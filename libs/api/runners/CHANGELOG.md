## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8100b48: Adds the provisioned-runner reconcile endpoint and shared request/response schemas for provisioner state recovery.
- 7a9943d: Adds the backend contract for per-step execution: job claims mint a lease token for the step API, step reports carry attempts and exit codes, and workflow completion can be signalled through the workflows outbox. The runner-side step loop is intentionally owned by the follow-up runner protocol work.
- 2bc5595: Adds workflow-run cancellation across the API, orchestration queue cleanup, event contract, and run-page cancel action.
- c47be09: Reshape Scheduling around runner job leases. Jobs are now enqueued with `workflowRunId`, `workflowRunAttemptId`, `jobId`, and `jobExecutionId`; the claim route mints a job lease token and returns the same workflow/job identity tuple. The stuck-job detector emits `runners.job.lease_expired` with that tuple when a lease expires.
- f9f059e: Cut the runner protocol over to per-step pull/report and remove the job-atomic path.

  The job workflow now terminates on two signals: `job-finished` (raised by
  `recordStepResult` on step exhaustion) and `job-lease-expired` (raised by the new
  `runners.job.lease_expired` subscriber). A precedence ladder keeps a genuinely
  finished job from being failed by a late lease expiry, and the lease-expiry branch
  re-derives the outcome from the authoritative step projection in a single
  transaction (server state is the final gate). On finish the workflow releases the
  lease via `releaseJob` (deleting both the running and any orphaned pending row);
  release is best-effort so a Scheduling outage never blocks the run DAG.

  Removed the atomic path end to end: the runner `POST /runners/jobs/:jobId/complete`
  route, the `RUNNER_JOB_COMPLETED` event, `finalizeRunningJob`/`completeJob`, the
  `applyStepResults*` apply path and its workflow subscriber, and the dead
  `jobPayload*`/`complete-job` DTO schemas. The runner now parses the step-less claim
  response, and `claimPendingJob` drops an orphan pending row instead of poison-looping.

  Internal breaking change (deleted exported DTOs/events and a runner route, plus a
  Temporal signal rename) consumed only within this monorepo; backend and agent ship
  together.

- 1c1fb3e: Adds shared fixed-window rate limiting for provisioner token minting and ephemeral runner registration.
- fb64f13: Adds a job lease capability token (HS256, `verifyJobLeaseToken` plus the claims schema) so runner step calls can be authenticated in-process without a hop back to Scheduling.
- 03d9eae: Adds runner-advertised tool capabilities to registration, heartbeat, persistence, and runner protocol reporting.
- 6181819: Adds runner registration sessions with bounded label contracts, session-token auth, and lease-token heartbeat ownership.

### Patch Changes

- 2325d76: Adds provisioned-runner terminate intent signals for cancelled bound jobs across runner polling and reconcile responses.
- 89026d5: Fixes provisioned-runner reconcile results when fresh lifecycle reports commit during stale-absent termination.
- c0a883c: Moves the job lease capability token codec and its claims schema from the runners packages into api-auth/api-auth-dto, renaming its config to `AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_*`, so all signed-token codecs live with authentication. Adds a shared leased-job auth context for request-scoped lease claims, and a shared `createLeaseTokenAuthMethod` (the `leased-job` auth method) registered on the auth module so any feature module can protect routes with a lease token by name.
- ae7a63c: Adds daily dispatched outbox row retention with bounded cleanup batches and retention indexes on module outbox tables.
- 5729548: Stuck-job expiry now reaps a bounded batch in one transaction instead of N+1: a single `DELETE … RETURNING` (oldest-first, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, capped at 100 per tick) feeds a multi-row outbox insert via the new `writeOutboxEvents` helper. Behavior is unchanged (same rows reaped, one `runners.job.lease_expired` event per reaped job, same orphan-pending sweep).
- e250c4c: Propagates `projectId` end-to-end into the job lease token. Workflows sources the `{workspaceId, projectId, workflowRunId, workflowRunAttemptId, jobId, jobExecutionId}` identity tuple and threads it through the runner pending/running job tables and lease claims. This is lease-shape groundwork for per-project log-ingest authorization; the stream-stamping consumer lands separately.
- 2617db9: Folds the runner database migrations into a single baseline and drops six redundant indexes; the resulting schema is unchanged.
- 247cbd6: Adds label-aware runner job claiming with shared runner-label validation and required-label orchestration.
- 1d98b19: Rewrites the pending-job claim query with the Drizzle query builder instead of raw SQL, keeping the same FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED locking behavior.
- 5823bac: Removes the per-request workspace existence and status check from provisioner token auth, severing the last `@shipfox/api-workspaces` dependency in `@shipfox/api-runners`; workspace-status enforcement on the provisioner path moves to the upcoming workspace removal/disable work.
- 75520ff: Add the foundation for metrics observability. `@shipfox/node-module` gains an optional `metrics` hook on `ShipfoxModule` plus `registerModuleMetrics`, a declarative slot for modules to register service-level metrics (observable gauges) once at app startup, kept separate from `initializeModules` so unit tests never bind the metrics port. `@shipfox/api-runners` is instrumented as the worked example across both planes: instance counters for job enqueue, claim, and lease expiry recorded inline, and `runners_pending_jobs` / `runners_running_jobs` observable gauges over a new `getJobQueueDepth` query wired through the module hook.
- 62720ea: Consolidates runner label canonicalization on `@shipfox/runner-labels` across runner scheduling and protocol code.
- b855d6f: Adds reconciliation observability metrics for provisioned-runner divergence and terminate-intent reconciliation.
- 362b3eb: Scope runner log append authorization to the dispatched step attempt carried by the job lease token.
- 3bea87f: Adds a typed `subscriberFactory` that binds each outbox event name to its payload type at construction, so subscriber handlers receive a typed `(payload, event)` and the per-handler `event.payload as X` casts are gone; a private brand makes the factory the only way to build a module subscriber.
- 82d22e4: Make the workspace-membership gate stateless. `requireWorkspaceAccess` now lives in `@shipfox/api-auth-context` and authorizes a request purely from the verified session-token claims, replacing the `requireMembership` gate in `@shipfox/api-workspaces` that read the workspace row from the database on every workspace-scoped request. Membership and role already travel in the token, so the check needs no database access.

  This removes the per-request database read and severs the runtime dependency on `@shipfox/api-workspaces` from feature modules that only needed the membership gate (integration providers, secrets, projects, agent, runners). Workspace existence and `active`-status enforcement, which no code path currently exercises, moves off the hot path; enforce it at token issuance when workspace suspension is introduced.

- 2933c33: Adds drain-boundary Zod validation for current outbox publisher event payloads.
- 8b9c3e0: Runs the API runners and integration core test suites without per-file Vitest module isolation, removing runner auth-helper mocks and cleaning up module-reset handling for shared test modules.
- 0dd23a7: Warns on agent tool capability mismatches during dispatch without blocking label-matched runners.
- 8ecc121: Track queue/run/finish timing for workflow runs and jobs. Adds nullable `started_at`/`finished_at` to workflow runs and `queued_at`/`started_at`/`finished_at` to jobs, exposed on the run and job DTOs. The runners module emits two new authoritative-timestamp events (`runners.job.queued`, `runners.job.started`) in the same transaction as the enqueue/claim; workflows projects them onto the job row with a first-write-wins `coalesce`, so the at-least-once outbox can redeliver out of order safely. Run `started_at`/`finished_at` and job `finished_at` are stamped in-module at the status transitions. All columns are nullable and eventually consistent, so consumers must treat a missing endpoint as "not yet known" and clamp any duration math.
