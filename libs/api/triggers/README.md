# Shipfox API Triggers

Shipfox API Triggers decides when a workflow run starts. It projects the
`triggers` map from each workflow YAML into an indexed subscription table,
matches incoming integration events against those subscriptions, and starts
a workflow run for every match. It also exposes HTTP routes that fire manual
runs and inspect received trigger events.

## Example

Register the module with the API module runner:

```ts
import {createTriggersModule} from '@shipfox/api-triggers';
import {definitionsInterModuleContract} from '@shipfox/api-definitions-dto/inter-module';
import {integrationsInterModuleContract} from '@shipfox/api-integration-core-dto/inter-module';
import {projectsInterModuleContract} from '@shipfox/api-projects-dto/inter-module';
import {workflowsInterModuleContract} from '@shipfox/api-workflows-dto/inter-module';
import {createApp, listen} from '@shipfox/node-fastify';
import {initializeModules, startModuleWorkers} from '@shipfox/node-module';
import {
  createInMemoryInterModuleTransport,
  registerInterModulePresentations,
} from '@shipfox/node-module/inter-module';

const transport = createInMemoryInterModuleTransport();
const workflows = transport.createClient(workflowsInterModuleContract);
const definitions = transport.createClient(definitionsInterModuleContract);
const integrations = transport.createClient(integrationsInterModuleContract);
const projects = transport.createClient(projectsInterModuleContract);
const modules = [
  createTriggersModule({workflows, definitions, projects, integrations}),
  /* and other modules */
];
registerInterModulePresentations({transport, modules});
transport.seal();
const {auth, routes, workers} = await initializeModules({
  modules,
});

await createApp({auth, routes});
await startModuleWorkers({workers});
await listen();
```

### Migration from `triggersModule`

`triggersModule` is replaced by `createTriggersModule({workflows, definitions, projects})`. The API
composition root creates the Workflows, Definitions, Projects, and (when E2E synthetic dispatch is
needed) Integrations clients from their `@shipfox/api-*-dto/inter-module` contracts. It passes those
clients to Triggers, registers the presentations, and seals the transport before the server starts. Cron
activities, integration subscribers, and the manual and dev-run routes use those
injected clients. Callers must keep the deterministic cron or integration key when they
retry a trigger command. The manual route creates one new key for each request.

This adds:

- triggers database migrations from `libs/api/triggers/drizzle`
- the `POST /workflow-definitions/:definitionId/fire-manual` route
- the `POST /dev-runs` route, which creates a run from a workflow file at a git ref without creating a trigger subscription
- the `GET /trigger-events`, `GET /trigger-events/facets`, and `GET /trigger-events/:id` inspection routes
- subscribers for `DEFINITION_RESOLVED`, `DEFINITION_DELETED`, and
  `INTEGRATION_EVENT_RECEIVED`
- the `triggers` outbox publisher
- the hourly `triggers-prune-trigger-events` Temporal cron, which deletes old
  rows from `triggers_received_events`

A workflow YAML opts into triggers like this:

```yaml
triggers:
  on_demand:
    source: manual
  on_push:
    source: github_acme
    event: push
    filter: event.ref == "refs/heads/main"
```

Each source is an integration connection slug or a built-in source (`manual`, `cron`). Each map key is the trigger's `name`. A workflow may declare any number of
integration triggers and at most one `source: manual` trigger; the manual
invariant is enforced at parse time so the fire route stays unambiguous.
The `event` field is optional. Omitting it subscribes the trigger to every
event the source delivers. A source that delivers one event receives that
one: `manual` receives `fire`, `cron` receives `tick`, and a custom webhook
integration connection receives `received`. The normalizer materializes `fire` and `tick`
for the two built-in sources. An omitted event on an integration source
becomes a source subscription that matches any event from that integration connection.

Integration triggers may include a CEL `filter` predicate. Dispatch evaluates
the predicate for every subscription that matches `(workspace_id, source,
event)` with the context `{event: payload, trigger: {source, event}}`. A
missing filter matches; `true` creates a run; and `false` skips the subscription
and can leave the event `discarded`. A non-boolean result or evaluation failure
records a structured `filter-error` decision and fails closed without creating
a run. The `trigger` object contains only `source` and `event` while this filter
runs; definition validation rejects other trigger fields.

Webhook triggers use the webhook connection slug as `source` and the fixed
event name `received`. A delivery to `POST /webhook/:connectionId` publishes
an `INTEGRATION_EVENT_RECEIVED` envelope with `provider: webhook`,
`source: <connection.slug>`, `event: received`, and payload
`{method, headers, query, body}`. Trigger dispatch matches only on
`(workspace_id, source, event)`, so a workflow that listens to a webhook uses
the slug plus `event: received`:

```yaml
triggers:
  on_stripe:
    source: stripe_prod
    event: received
```

Workflow interpolation exposes the webhook envelope as `event`, so steps can
read values such as `${{ event.body.payment_id }}` and
`${{ event.headers["x-stripe-signature"] }}`. Header/body-derived event
subtypes are not part of this contract.

GitHub triggers use the raw GitHub webhook resource name, plus the payload
`action` when one is present. For example, a pull request open event is
`pull_request.opened`, an issue close event is `issues.closed`, and a
release publish event is `release.published`. Events without an action use
the bare resource name, such as `push` or `fork`. Common GitHub events are:
`push`, `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.closed`, `issues.opened`,
`issues.closed`, `issue_comment.created`, `release.published`,
`workflow_run.completed`, `installation.created`, and
`installation_repositories.added`. GitHub only sends events that the GitHub
App is subscribed to in its Permissions & events settings.

## Setup

Install the package from the registry:

```sh
pnpm add @shipfox/api-triggers
```

The matching HTTP contract lives in
[`@shipfox/api-triggers-dto`](../triggers-dto). Import Zod schemas and DTO
types from there when you call the route from the client.

The package reads `TRIGGER_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` to decide how many days of
received trigger events to keep before the maintenance cron deletes them.
It also depends on the API database connection from `@shipfox/node-postgres`.

## Routes

The routes are mounted by the host app under the `/workflow-definitions` and
`/trigger-events` prefixes.

| Method | Path | Auth | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/workflow-definitions/:definitionId/fire-manual` | bearer token | Fires the workflow's manual trigger and returns the new `workflow_run_id`. Optional `inputs` in the body are forwarded to the run. |
| `GET` | `/trigger-events?workspace_id=:workspaceId` | bearer token | Lists received trigger events for a workspace, newest first. Supports source, event, origin, outcome, `replayable=true`, received-at window, limit, and cursor filters. List items include the optional source event ID for replay rows. |
| `GET` | `/trigger-events/facets?workspace_id=:workspaceId` | bearer token | Returns the workspace's distinct `source`, `event`, and `origin` filter values with counts (top 50 each, by count). Backs the Events page filter dropdowns. |
| `GET` | `/trigger-events/:id` | bearer token | Returns one received trigger event with its full payload, routing decisions, optional source event ID, and replay links. Cross-workspace ids return `404`. |

The manual route is keyed by workflow definition id, not subscription id. The
server resolves the manual subscription for the workflow internally; the
"at most one manual trigger per workflow" invariant from the parser keeps
that lookup unambiguous. Integration sources (github, etc.) fire through
the event bus and have no HTTP entry point.

## Vocabulary

Three words, used the same way at every layer.

| Word | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **source** | Where the trigger came from: an integration connection slug or a built-in source. | `github_acme`, `gitlab_prod`, `sentry_prod`, `manual`, `cron` |
| **event** | The specific thing that happened, scoped to a source. Omitted on a subscription means every event the source delivers. | `push`, `issue_comment`, `alert_triggered`, `fire`, `tick` |
| **payload** | The data carried by the event, set by the producing integration. Triggers passes it through opaquely. | GitHub's raw webhook JSON for `(github_acme, push)` |

The `name` field on a subscription is the YAML map key (for example
`on_push`). It identifies the trigger inside a workflow definition and is
unique per `(workflow_definition_id, name)`.

### Words we do not use

- `provider`: reserved for the integration module's identity
  (`integrations_connections.provider`). Trigger code says `source`.
- `eventType` / `type`: replaced by `event`. The bare word `type` would
  collide with TypeScript discriminators and with the `IntegrationProvider`
  capability `type` field.
- `triggerContext`: the runtime payload on a run is called
  `triggerPayload`.
- `kind`: every trigger is identified by `(source, event)`. There is no
  separate axis.

## Architecture

Triggers flow through three layers. The YAML map is the source of truth,
the subscription table is the queryable projection, and the workflow run
table is the immutable history.

```

### Layer 1: workflow definition (source of truth)

The YAML `triggers` map lives inside `workflow_definitions.definition`
(JSONB owned by the definitions module). That is the only place trigger
declarations live in raw form.

### Layer 2: projection (queryable)

`triggers_subscriptions` is rebuilt from `DEFINITION_RESOLVED` events,
which carry the parsed `triggers` map. The triggers module never reads the
definitions table: the event is the contract.

Cron triggers also project into `triggers_cron_schedules`, keyed by
`subscription_id`. That table stores the resolved cron expression, timezone,
next fire time, and last fire time used by the cron firing engine.

Indexes:

- `(workflow_definition_id, name)`: unique. One row per YAML trigger.
- `(workspace_id, source, event)`: the hot path for matching incoming
  integration events at workspace scope.
- `(workflow_definition_id)`: used to clean up the projection on
  `DEFINITION_DELETED`.
- `triggers_cron_schedules.next_fire_at`: used to drain due cron schedules
  in next-fire order.

### Layer 3: run history (immutable)

`workflow_runs.trigger_source` and `trigger_event` are indexed text
columns. `trigger_payload` is a JSONB column typed by `TriggerPayload`:
`manual`/`cron` carry their own typed shapes, while integration events use
a generic `{source, event, deliveryId, data}` shape that forwards the raw
event payload as `data`. The `triggerSource` value on a row always equals
`triggerPayload.source`. The duplication is deliberate: the indexed column
is for filtering, the payload is for inspection.

## Events

| Event | Published by | Consumed by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `INTEGRATION_EVENT_RECEIVED` | `integration/*` | triggers, projects | An integration received a webhook and validated it. The payload is the integration's domain event. |
| `DEFINITION_RESOLVED` | definitions | triggers | A workflow definition was created or updated. The payload includes the parsed `triggers` map. |
| `DEFINITION_DELETED` | definitions | triggers | A workflow definition was soft-deleted. Subscription rows are removed. |

## API

The package exports the module entry point:

```ts
import {triggersModule} from '@shipfox/api-triggers';
```

It also exports lower-level pieces for tests and advanced wiring:

- `fireManualTrigger()`: shared core function used by the session route and
  inter-module command. It passes an optional idempotency key to workflow run
  creation and returns the deduplication result.
- `fireManualSubscription()`: lower-level manual-fire function used by the
  shared core. Throws `TriggerSubscriptionNotFoundError`,
  `TriggerSubscriptionNotManualError`, or `TriggerWorkspaceMismatchError`.
- `createDevRun()`: shared core function used by `POST /dev-runs` and the
  inter-module command. It resolves the definition at a git ref, fires a manual
  or cron trigger without a subscription row, and journals the attempt. It does
  not use an idempotency key.
- `ManualTriggerNotFoundError`: thrown by the route handler when the
  caller's workspace cannot reach the workflow, or the workflow declares
  no manual trigger. Surfaced as `404 manual-trigger-not-found`.
- `findMatchingSubscriptions()`: hot-path lookup by
  `(workspace_id, source, event)`.
- `getManualSubscriptionByDefinitionId()`: resolves the single manual
  subscription for a workflow definition (or `undefined` if none).
- `getTriggerSubscriptionById()` and
  `listSubscriptionsByWorkflowDefinitionIds()`: read helpers.
- `db`, `migrationsPath`, and `triggersOutbox`: the Drizzle handle,
  migration path, and outbox table.
- Entity type: `TriggerSubscription`.

## Adding a new source

To wire a new integration source (for example GitLab):

1. Add a payload type for each supported event to
   `@shipfox/api-integration-core-dto` (for example `GitlabPushPayload`).
2. In the new `integration/<source>` package, receive webhooks and publish
   `INTEGRATION_EVENT_RECEIVED` with `source: '<name>'`,
   `event: '<type>'`, and the payload.

That is the whole list. The triggers subscriber is source-agnostic: it
matches subscriptions on `(workspace, source, event)` and forwards the raw
payload through the generic `TriggerPayload` shape, so no change to the
triggers module, the projection schema, the run table, or `TriggerPayload`
is needed for a new source. Author workflows that subscribe to the new
`(source, event)` and narrow `triggerPayload.data` themselves.

For Sentry's supported `(source, event)` values, see
[`@shipfox/api-integration-sentry`](../integration/sentry).
