## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a56748d: Adds ingestion-time agent session parsing with a stored canonical SessionView read endpoint and workflow harness lookup.
- f92122b: Adds the logs module foundation: a stateless monolith module with its own schema, the runner-facing offset-CAS append endpoint (job-lease authenticated, idempotent, multi-instance safe), a per-job accrual budget with a cap tombstone, and an S3-compatible client targeting Garage at startup. The NDJSON v1 record contract lives in the new `@shipfox/api-logs-dto` package, and `@shipfox/node-fastify` gains a `createRawBodyPlugin({contentType, bodyLimit})` factory for byte-exact request bodies.
- 4207772: Add the session-authenticated log read endpoint: `GET /steps/:stepId/attempts/:attempt/logs?cursor=N`. One cursor endpoint serves both the live tail and the full history of a step attempt, workspace-scoped through the stream row's denormalized `workspaceId` (a 404 covers both a missing stream and a cross-workspace step, so existence never leaks).
  - Open or closed-but-uncompacted streams return inline NDJSON read from the hot Postgres chunks, walked by chunk `seq` so server-injected control tombstones (`capped`, `runner_lost`) interleave with runner bytes exactly as compaction concatenates them. The inline bytes are therefore byte-identical to the decompressed compacted object. Pages are bounded by `LOG_READ_INLINE_MAX_BYTES` (default 1 MiB), with a `has_more` flag and a `next_cursor` the client drains before it tails.
  - Compacted streams (`object_key` set) return a presigned GET URL (`LOG_READ_URL_TTL_SECONDS`, default 3600) plus `total_bytes`, `expires_at`, and `truncated`, so the browser fetches the object directly and API egress is bypassed.
  - `@shipfox/api-logs-dto` gains `readLogsQuerySchema` and the `readLogsResponseSchema` discriminated union (`inline` or `presigned`) so the backend, client, and E2E helpers share one contract. `@shipfox/api-logs` adds the `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` dependency.

### Patch Changes

- 68e4022: Collapse the log stream `kind` into one stream per `(job, step, attempt)`. `kind` was modeled at the wrong layer: the runner already funnels every record through one spool and one offset axis, so the per-kind split (separate stream rows, identity, and ingest dispatch) was unnecessary server-side modeling. A reader now pulls every record for a step attempt and filters by the record `type` at read time, without passing a kind.
  - The append request drops the `kind` query param and `LogStreamClosedEvent` drops `kind`. `streamKind`/`StreamKind` and the `agent_session` line validator (`parseSessionLine`) are removed.
  - `attempt_streams` identity becomes `(job, step, attempt)`; the `kind` and now-dead `capped` columns are dropped (budget cap is signaled in-band by a `capped` tombstone and tracked in `job_accounting`). The close path injects `capped`/`runner_lost` tombstones uniformly.
  - `LOG_MAX_SESSION_LINE_BYTES` is removed and `LOG_APPEND_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` is right-sized to 1 MiB. The runner's flush-window comment is corrected to match (the server body limit is now 1 MiB, no longer 8 MiB).

  Agent-session capture (its own record `type`(s) and runner producer) is deferred to the agent-sessions feature, which will emit those records into this same stream.

- ae7a63c: Adds daily dispatched outbox row retention with bounded cleanup batches and retention indexes on module outbox tables.
- d49ee4c: Forward agent step session entries into the logs module as opaque `agent_session` records: the runner tails the pi session file and forwards each verbatim entry over a shared log-stream sink, and the write path stores them with a configurable per-line size cap sized for inline base64 content.
- 8cab4e7: Close a log stream so it becomes eligible for compaction. A committed `end` record declared-closes the stream inside the append transaction, and a `WORKFLOWS_JOB_TERMINATED` subscriber arms a grace-then-close Temporal workflow that force-closes any stream the runner never ended (appending a `runner_lost` tombstone and marking it truncated). Both paths route through one guarded close that writes a single `logs.stream.closed` outbox event, and a closed-stream guard drops later appends. Adds `closed_at` and three partial indexes to the stream table.
- b4103b5: Delete expired logs from both object storage and Postgres on an hourly cron, with a configurable horizon (`LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 90), enforced by our own worker rather than bucket lifecycle rules so behavior is identical across object stores. A retention sweep drains closed streams past the horizon in batches, bounded by a self-imposed time budget so a timed-out run never overlaps the next; per stream it first hard-deletes the row (chunks cascading), guarded on the observed `object_key` so a concurrent compaction publish is left intact, then deletes the whole attempt object prefix (reclaiming orphan leaves left behind by a losing compaction attempt). Failed or raced rows are skipped for the rest of the run so a poison row cannot starve the streams behind it, and a `job_accounting` row is pruned only when its job has no remaining streams and no recent activity, so a live job's budget is never reset.
- b0a0e1a: Reap log streams that leak open after the one-shot job-terminated close. That sweep snapshots a job's open streams once, so a stream whose first append lands after it ran was never closed and leaked forever: open streams are invisible to compaction and retention (both keyed on `state = 'closed'`). A new `reapStaleOpenStreamsCron` (every 10 minutes, on the logs lifecycle queue, staggered off the retention sweep) force-closes any stream left open past the job-lease window, marking it truncated so it re-enters the compaction and retention lifecycle. Adds the `LOG_STREAM_REAP_AFTER_SECONDS` config (default 7200s; startup validates it exceeds the configured `AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`, read from auth's `config`) and the `logs_attempt_streams_open_age_idx` partial index.
- 2883ab4: Add a stream `kind` to the logs contract and harden the write path. Streams are now identified by `(job, step, attempt, kind)` with two kinds: `log_stream` (process output) and `agent_session` (verbatim, format-agnostic agent JSONL).
  - The record envelope drops `src` to `{v, ts}`; the stdout/stderr pipe moves to `stream` on output, and control records become a flat `type` discriminator with multi-level named groups (`group_id`/`parent_group_id`, capped depth with overflow flattening).
  - The append validator is split into an appendable union and a read union, so a forged server-only `capped`/`runner_lost` tombstone is rejected. `agent_session` lines are stored verbatim after a whole-line, fatal-UTF-8, JSON-well-formedness check within a configurable line cap; the budget cap never injects an in-band tombstone into a session, and close derives its `capped`/`truncated` flags out of band.
  - The append request carries `kind`; the shared body limit and session line cap are configurable with a startup invariant.

- 4c39cb5: Makes log retention delete object prefixes before stream rows so transient object-storage delete failures leave rows discoverable for a later sweep instead of permanently orphaning billed objects.
- 150f378: Compact a closed log stream's hot Postgres chunks into one gzip-compressed NDJSON object in object storage, record the object key on the stream row, and delete the chunk rows. Compaction is a Temporal workflow started from the `logs.stream.closed` event (deduped per stream) on a dedicated task queue, with a reconcile cron backstop that re-drives any closed stream whose compaction never started or permanently failed. Crash-safe and idempotent: each attempt uploads to its own per-attempt object key and a single-winner publish (atomic object-key set and chunk delete, guarded by `object_key IS NULL`) records exactly one, so a slow or retried attempt can never overwrite a published object; a streamed-vs-table integrity check over chunk count, last seq, and byte total guards the irreversible chunk delete. Keeps Postgres bounded by in-flight work rather than retention.
- 362b3eb: Scope runner log append authorization to the dispatched step attempt carried by the job lease token.
- 3bea87f: Adds a typed `subscriberFactory` that binds each outbox event name to its payload type at construction, so subscriber handlers receive a typed `(payload, event)` and the per-handler `event.payload as X` casts are gone; a private brand makes the factory the only way to build a module subscriber.
- 8ac88f3: Runs the API logs test suite without per-file Vitest module isolation by replacing cached module mocks with explicit test dependencies.
- 2933c33: Adds drain-boundary Zod validation for current outbox publisher event payloads.
