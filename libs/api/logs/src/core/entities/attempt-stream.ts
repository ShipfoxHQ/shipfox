 * A single `(job, step, attempt)` log stream. Identity is scoped to the lease's
 * job. `workspaceId`, `projectId`, and `workflowRunAttemptId` are stamped from the lease on
 * stream creation and asserted on subsequent appends, so reads can authorize
 * per-project without joining back to workflows. `committedLength` is the
 * offset-CAS axis: raw NDJSON spool bytes the server has durably accepted from
 * the runner.
 *
 * `truncated` is an out-of-band terminal flag set when the timeout sweep
 * force-closes a stream the runner never ended. Budget exhaustion ("capped") is a
 * job-level signal recorded in `job_accounting` and surfaced in-band by a `capped`
 * tombstone record, not on the stream row.
