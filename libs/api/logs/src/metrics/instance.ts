// Byte-volume counters use the OpenTelemetry byte unit so Prometheus appends `_bytes` to the
// metric name. The two ingest axes MUST stay distinct:
//
//   raw ingested (CAS axis)      normalized stored (read axis)
//   append body bytes accepted   durable chunk bytes written after ingest
//   by the offset-CAS, before    normalization (agent_session records are parsed
//   normalization                into view rows), excluding server tombstones
//
// `logs_bytes_ingested` counts what the protocol accepted: every in-order CAS extension,
// including cap-crossing appends and post-cap accept-and-drop stragglers (their
// `committed_length` advances, so they are accepted even though nothing is stored).
// Retries, gaps, closed-stream appends, and empty heartbeats never extend the CAS and are
// never counted, so the same bytes are never double-counted. Runner and server-origin
// appends share the axis; the server-origin append derives its offset from the stream tail.
//
// `logs_bytes_stored` counts only normalized bodies durably written as chunk rows, so a
// capped job's dropped straggler and server-injected tombstones do
// not inflate it. ingested - stored is the normalization delta plus cap/close drops.
