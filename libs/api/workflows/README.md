# Shipfox API Workflows

Shipfox API Workflows creates and runs workflow definitions, jobs, executions, steps, and run history.

## What it does

- **`createWorkflowsModule`**: Registers workflow routes, persistence, events, subscribers, and orchestration.
- **`runWorkflow`**: Loads a definition and creates a run with its initial graph.
- **`WorkflowRun`**: Represents a run with UUID identity, status, trigger data, and display fields.
- **`loadRunningLeasedStep`**: Loads the step state available to a leased runner.

## Installation / Setup

```sh
pnpm add @shipfox/api-workflows
```

The module requires the Auth, Definitions, Integrations, Logs, Projects,
Runners, Secrets, Workspaces, Annotations, and Agent inter-module clients.

## Usage

```ts
import {runWorkflow} from '@shipfox/api-workflows';

const run = await runWorkflow(definitions, {
  agent,
  workspaceId,
  projectId,
  definitionId,
  triggerPayload: {
    source: 'manual',
    event: 'fire',
    subscriptionId,
    userId,
  },
});
```

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RUNNER_CATALOG_PATH` | empty | Optional path to a YAML file mapping runner catalog names to complete runner label sets. |
| `WORKFLOWS_LEGACY_TRIGGER_EVENTS_WRITE_ENABLED` | `true` | Writes legacy trigger-event arrays alongside canonical rows for new listener executions. Keep `true` during mixed deployments. Set `false` after one normal compatibility window with canonical readers, then restart the API. |
| `WORKFLOWS_TOOL_STEP_EXECUTOR_ENABLED` | `true` | Starts the server-side tool-step executor. Set `false` to stop claiming new tool invocations after an API restart. |
| `WORKFLOWS_TOOL_STEP_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Delay between scans for due server-executed tool-step invocations, in milliseconds. The value must be a safe whole number from `1` through `2147483647`. |
| `WORKFLOWS_TOOL_STEP_EXECUTOR_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Maximum number of tool-step invocations claimed in one executor pass. The value must be a safe whole number greater than `0`. |
| `WORKFLOWS_TOOL_STEP_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Maximum duration of one provider call, in milliseconds. The value must be a safe whole number from `1` through `2147483647`. |

The catalog is loaded and validated once when the Workflows module is imported;
restart the API after changing the file. An empty YAML document behaves like an
unset path; a `null` or comment-only document is invalid. Catalog names and
labels are canonicalized to lowercase.
Values that do not match a catalog name remain literal labels, so a misspelled
catalog name can leave a job waiting for a runner that never advertises it.

```yaml
# runner-catalog.yaml
shipfox-4cpu:
  - arch.amd64
  - cpu.4
```

## Routes / API / Data Model

Workflow routes keep UUIDs in path and query parameters. The run response
includes both `id` and `number`. The UUID identifies the run. The number is a
display label and workflow expression value.

## Behavior Notes

Listener event rows are canonical for new execution context. The legacy
execution array remains readable for retained executions and is not backfilled.
The writer flag defaults to dual writes for mixed deployments. Set it to `false`
after canonical readers complete one normal compatibility window. An array-only
reader cannot recover event context from new executions after the flag changes.
If rollback is needed, restore a release that reads canonical rows first. An
array-only rollback requires a dual-write bridge.

The duplicate-array storage gauge is transitional. Its cached refresh still
scans retained execution history. Remove it after the compatibility window and
legacy-array retention cleanup. The canonical listener-event gauges remain
useful for retention operations.

Run numbers are sequential within one workflow lineage, start at `1`, and are
unique for `(definition_id, number)`. `workflow_runs.definition_id` carries the
workflow lineage id: a stable identity per `(project_id, config_path)` shared by
every definition row of one workflow file. Pathless manual definitions share one
project-scoped lineage because they have no config path. Runs of a file keep one
numbering sequence before and after the file merges. The column keeps its v1 name;
a rename is a separate cleanup. Legacy definition rows are reconciled when read
or synchronized; the schema migration only adds nullable lineage storage. The
Workflows module allocates the number with a per-lineage counter inside the
run-creation transaction. It resolves trigger
idempotency before allocation, so a duplicate delivery returns the original run
without consuming another number.

Gaps are acceptable because the number is a label and monotonicity matters more
than density. Counter rows stay after a definition is removed, and reruns create
another attempt on the same run without consuming a number.

Run numbers are never addresses. No route resolves a run by its number, and run
URLs continue to use the run UUID. A run number is useful in workflow
expressions as `run.number` and should appear beside the workflow name when it is
shown in a list.

### Observability

The executor records instance metrics on each API pod and service metrics from
shared invocation state. Labels stay bounded, and workflow or tool identifiers
remain in logs and traces.

| Metric | Plane | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workflows_tool_invocation_duration_ms` | Instance | `provider`, `outcome` | Elapsed time for a claimed tool invocation through its durable result. The histogram uses millisecond units and explicit buckets through 120 seconds. |
| `workflows_tool_invocation_reclaims` | Instance | `action` | Expired or non-retryable claims handled by the executor. `requeued` means the call advances for another read attempt. `failed` means the invocation is settled as interrupted. |
| `workflows_next_step_response_size` | Instance | `kind` | Serialized `/steps/next` response size in bytes (`unit: By`) by `step`, `wait`, or `done`; explicit buckets are 1,024, 10,240, 100,000, 256,000, 500,000, 868,928, and 1,000,000 bytes. |
| `workflows_next_step_response_overflow` | Instance | `kind` | Count of serialized `/steps/next` responses over the 1,000,000-byte budget; overflow is reported while the response remains served. |
| `workflows_tool_invocations_queued` | Service | none | Current count of queued tool invocations across the shared database. |
| `workflows_tool_invocations_in_flight` | Service | none | Current count of tool invocations claimed by an executor. |
| `workflows_listener_event_rows` | Service | none | Number of retained canonical listener-event rows across the shared database. The value is cached for up to 60 seconds. |
| `workflows_listener_event_payload_bytes` | Service | none | Stored payload bytes for retained canonical listener-event rows with a payload. The value is cached for up to 60 seconds. |
| `workflows_listener_event_consumed_oldest_age` | Service | none | Age in milliseconds of the oldest consumed canonical listener-event row still retained. This is a retention-depth signal, not a consumer-liveness signal. The value is `0` when no matching row exists or its timestamp is in the future. The value is cached for up to 60 seconds. |
| `workflows_listener_event_pending_oldest_age` | Service | none | Age in milliseconds of the oldest pending canonical listener-event row. The value is `0` when no matching row exists or its timestamp is in the future. The value is cached for up to 60 seconds. |
| `workflows_duplicate_trigger_events_bytes` | Service | none | Serialized bytes retained in legacy job-execution trigger-event arrays. The value is cached for up to 60 seconds. |

## Development

```sh
turbo check --filter=@shipfox/api-workflows
turbo type --filter=@shipfox/api-workflows
turbo test --filter=@shipfox/api-workflows
```

DB-backed workflow tests need local Postgres from `docker compose up -d`.
