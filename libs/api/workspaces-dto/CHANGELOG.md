## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b79cda: Add a workspace-created domain event.
- c2db8c3: Adds workspace member invitation and join lifecycle events to the workspaces outbox.
- 326f4c0: Exposes Workspaces inter-module operations and moves Auth and OAuth providers onto injected clients.

### Patch Changes

- 4a91956: Publishes a shared provider-neutral `emailSchema` in `@shipfox/api-common-dto` and adopts it across auth and workspace invitation inputs. Adds a read-only `findUserByEmail`/`EmailOwner` seam to `@shipfox/api-auth` for looking up the current owner of a normalized email without creating a session or mutating that user. Extends the packed external consumer gate to exercise both seams against PostgreSQL through installed tarballs.
