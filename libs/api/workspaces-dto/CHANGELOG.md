## 15.0.0

## 12.0.0

### Minor Changes

## 11.0.0

### Major Changes

- 25158c8: Carry workspace lifecycle status in JWT membership claims and enforce suspended or inactive access at the stateless workspace gate while keeping access-token verification stateless.

  `getAuthenticatedSessionContext()` now reads refresh-session metadata from verified access-token claims without checking active refresh-session state; revoking a refresh session does not invalidate an already-issued access token.

## 10.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 07e7371: Add idempotent administrator workspace suspension and reactivation commands with atomic redacted administration events.

## 10.0.0

### Minor Changes

  best-effort job counts, and a neutral unavailable-workspace member experience for
  suspended or deleted workspaces.

- @shipfox/inter-module@0.2.0

## 6.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b79cda: Add a workspace-created domain event.
- c2db8c3: Adds workspace member invitation and join lifecycle events to the workspaces outbox.
- 326f4c0: Exposes Workspaces inter-module operations and moves Auth and OAuth providers onto injected clients.

### Patch Changes

- 4a91956: Publishes a shared provider-neutral `emailSchema` in `@shipfox/api-common-dto` and adopts it across auth and workspace invitation inputs. Adds a read-only `findUserByEmail`/`EmailOwner` seam to `@shipfox/api-auth` for looking up the current owner of a normalized email without creating a session or mutating that user. Extends the packed external consumer gate to exercise both seams against PostgreSQL through installed tarballs.
- Updated dependencies [4a91956]

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1b0d344]
  - @shipfox/api-common-dto@2.0.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d02c5fd: Queues auth and workspace transactional emails through module-owned outbox events so account verification, password reset, and invitation sends retry outside request transactions.

### Patch Changes

- 72ce351: Removes the legacy workspace API-key auth surface, its DTOs, project-access branch, database table, and token prefix support.
- 27770eb: Tightens signup, workspace, and project display-name validation with shared trimming, control and format-character rejection, length limits, and contextual client form errors.
