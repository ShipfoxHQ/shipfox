# Shipfox API Workspaces

Shipfox API Workspaces manages who can use a workspace and send or accept invites.

## What it does

- **`createWorkspacesModule`**: Adds table changes, API routes, outbox events, and metrics.
- **`ensureMembership`**: Adds a user to a workspace or returns the row that is there.
- **Invitation helpers**: Make, view, accept, list, and revoke invites.
- **Workspace helpers**: Read workspaces and check a signed-in user's access.

## Installation and setup

```sh
pnpm add @shipfox/api-workspaces
```

Set `CLIENT_BASE_URL` to the public client URL. Invite emails use this URL for
their accept links. Configure `@shipfox/node-mailer` when invite email must be sent.

## Usage

Call `ensureMembership` after an identity callback has the user profile:

```ts
import {ensureMembership} from '@shipfox/api-workspaces';

const membership = await ensureMembership({
  userId: user.id,
  userEmail: user.email,
  userName: user.name,
  workspaceId,
});
```

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLIENT_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | Base URL used in workspace invitation links. |
| `WORKSPACES_MAX_PER_WORKSPACE` | `10000` | Maximum number of members and open invitations per workspace. Must be between 1 and 10000, which is the complete members-list limit. |
| `AUTH_ROOT_KEY` | none | Root key used to HMAC source IPs for the workspace slug availability rate limit. |

Invitation email uses the shared `@shipfox/node-mailer` configuration.

## Routes / API / Data Model

Routes mount under `/workspaces`. They make, list, and update workspaces, check
workspace slug availability, manage members, and make, list, view, accept, or
revoke invites. Every workspace has a unique `slug` used in client URLs;
creating a workspace requires one, and `PATCH /workspaces/:workspaceId` can
rename it. A taken slug returns `slug-conflict`. Updates write a
`workspaces.workspace.updated` outbox event.
The composed module also mounts
`GET /admin/workspaces`, which requires the Auth `admin-observer` role and returns
bounded workspace identity, lifecycle, member, project, and best-effort job-count
summaries. Supporting count failures are represented as `unknown`. `POST
/admin/workspaces/:workspaceId/suspend` and `POST
/admin/workspaces/:workspaceId/reactivate` require the `admin-operator` role, an
`Idempotency-Key` header, and a `{reason}` body, and return `{workspace_id,
status, correlation_id}`. Both write a redacted `administration.action.performed`
outbox event and record their result for idempotent retries.

Workspace identity fields are:

| Field | Constraint | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | UUID, stable | API resource identity and foreign references |
| `name` | Required display text | Workspace label |
| `slug` | Required, globally unique resource slug | Client navigation and display |

The API keeps `id` in resource path parameters. `slug` is accepted on create and
update, and a duplicate returns `409 slug-conflict`. A slug change frees the old
value immediately. No API resource route resolves a workspace from its slug.

The module creates these tables:

- `workspaces`
- `workspaces_memberships`
- `workspaces_invitations`
- `workspaces_outbox`
- `workspaces_admin_command_results`
- `workspaces_rate_limits`

## Behavior notes

`ensureMembership` uses a unique database rule to keep one row for `user_id`
and `workspace_id`. Calls at the same time get the same row. It saves the email
and name only for a new row. Later calls do not change saved values. The metric
counts only new rows.

Invite acceptance keeps its current transaction. It does not change a row that
is already there.

`GET /workspaces/slug-availability?slug=acme` requires an authenticated user and
returns only `{available: boolean}`. A malformed slug returns 400. Requests are
limited to 60 per source IP in a five-minute window.

`ensureMembership` fails when its workspace does not exist. Workspace checks
throw `WorkspaceNotFoundError` or `MembershipRequiredError`. Invite helpers
throw their exported token and email mismatch errors when an invite cannot be
used.
