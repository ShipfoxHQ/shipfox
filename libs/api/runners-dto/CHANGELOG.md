## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8100b48: Adds the provisioned-runner reconcile endpoint and shared request/response schemas for provisioner state recovery.
- 7a9943d: Adds the backend contract for per-step execution: job claims mint a lease token for the step API, step reports carry attempts and exit codes, and workflow completion can be signalled through the workflows outbox. The runner-side step loop is intentionally owned by the follow-up runner protocol work.
- c47be09: Reshape Scheduling around runner job leases. Jobs are now enqueued with `workflowRunId`, `workflowRunAttemptId`, `jobId`, and `jobExecutionId`; the claim route mints a job lease token and returns the same workflow/job identity tuple. The stuck-job detector emits `runners.job.lease_expired` with that tuple when a lease expires.
- f9f059e: Cut the runner protocol over to per-step pull/report and remove the job-atomic path.

  The job workflow now terminates on two signals: `job-finished` (raised by
  `recordStepResult` on step exhaustion) and `job-lease-expired` (raised by the new
  `runners.job.lease_expired` subscriber). A precedence ladder keeps a genuinely
  finished job from being failed by a late lease expiry, and the lease-expiry branch
  re-derives the outcome from the authoritative step projection in a single
  transaction (server state is the final gate). On finish the workflow releases the
  lease via `releaseJob` (deleting both the running and any orphaned pending row);
  release is best-effort so a Scheduling outage never blocks the run DAG.

  Removed the atomic path end to end: the runner `POST /runners/jobs/:jobId/complete`
  route, the `RUNNER_JOB_COMPLETED` event, `finalizeRunningJob`/`completeJob`, the
  `applyStepResults*` apply path and its workflow subscriber, and the dead
  `jobPayload*`/`complete-job` DTO schemas. The runner now parses the step-less claim
  response, and `claimPendingJob` drops an orphan pending row instead of poison-looping.

  Internal breaking change (deleted exported DTOs/events and a runner route, plus a
  Temporal signal rename) consumed only within this monorepo; backend and agent ship
  together.

- 3afb7e3: Adds job execution success expressions and execution timeouts to workflow documents.
  Renames job execution IDs in auth, runner, workflow, and timeout event contracts to the explicit `jobExecutionId` / `job_execution_id` shape.
- fb64f13: Adds a job lease capability token (HS256, `verifyJobLeaseToken` plus the claims schema) so runner step calls can be authenticated in-process without a hop back to Scheduling.
- 03d9eae: Adds runner-advertised tool capabilities to registration, heartbeat, persistence, and runner protocol reporting.
- 6181819: Adds runner registration sessions with bounded label contracts, session-token auth, and lease-token heartbeat ownership.

### Patch Changes

- 2325d76: Adds provisioned-runner terminate intent signals for cancelled bound jobs across runner polling and reconcile responses.
- c0a883c: Moves the job lease capability token codec and its claims schema from the runners packages into api-auth/api-auth-dto, renaming its config to `AUTH_JOB_LEASE_TOKEN_*`, so all signed-token codecs live with authentication. Adds a shared leased-job auth context for request-scoped lease claims, and a shared `createLeaseTokenAuthMethod` (the `leased-job` auth method) registered on the auth module so any feature module can protect routes with a lease token by name.
- 247cbd6: Adds label-aware runner job claiming with shared runner-label validation and required-label orchestration.
- 62720ea: Consolidates runner label canonicalization on `@shipfox/runner-labels` across runner scheduling and protocol code.
- 88b9793: Adds runner demand polling schemas for provisioner reservation requests and responses.
- 2933c33: Adds drain-boundary Zod validation for current outbox publisher event payloads.
- a5c7562: Adds bounded runner idle polling with startup label validation and terminal session-exhaustion handling.
- 8ecc121: Track queue/run/finish timing for workflow runs and jobs. Adds nullable `started_at`/`finished_at` to workflow runs and `queued_at`/`started_at`/`finished_at` to jobs, exposed on the run and job DTOs. The runners module emits two new authoritative-timestamp events (`runners.job.queued`, `runners.job.started`) in the same transaction as the enqueue/claim; workflows projects them onto the job row with a first-write-wins `coalesce`, so the at-least-once outbox can redeliver out of order safely. Run `started_at`/`finished_at` and job `finished_at` are stamped in-module at the status transitions. All columns are nullable and eventually consistent, so consumers must treat a missing endpoint as "not yet known" and clamp any duration math.
