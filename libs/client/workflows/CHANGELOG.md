# @shipfox/client-workflows

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2bc5595: Adds workflow-run cancellation across the API, orchestration queue cleanup, event contract, and run-page cancel action.
- d69b164: Adds workflow run attempt lineage APIs and a run summary switcher for navigating rerun attempts.
- 2fb3e87: Derives workflow run attempt durations on the client and displays them in the run list and run header.
- e699508: Adds first-class skipped workflow jobs with persisted status reasons across API DTOs, orchestration, events, and client run views.

### Patch Changes

- dc3e434: Show logs inline under the active or selected workflow step attempt, including missing-stream retry for running attempts and stale-log retry states.
- 974b501: Moves manual workflow-run firing and optimistic run-list cache updates into `@shipfox/client-workflows` so project workflow pages consume the run cache owner directly.
- 228385c: Centralizes workflow run DTO mapping behind core client models for workflow UI components.
- a20b345: Compacts workflow job graph nodes and shows only current unresolved dependency counts.
- 8037501: Capture the `@shipfox/client-workflows` Storybook stories as Argos visual
  snapshots. Vitest now runs a browser `storybook` project that screenshots every
  story in light and dark and uploads them to the `client-workflows` Argos build
  in CI.
- 6e435dd: Add a resizable workflow source panel to the run page. The run summary exposes a Source control that opens the run's workflow YAML (from `source_snapshot`) in a page-level right panel, leaving the jobs graph and step attempts visible. The panel defaults to 720px and can be dragged between 420px and `min(1280px, 85vw)`.
- 5264a22: Adds a shared time ticker provider and hook for live elapsed-time displays that pause while hidden and slow down under reduced motion.
- 0b75eba: Replace the color-only job/run status dot with `WorkflowStatusIcon`, an icon-in-circle status glyph. Each state now carries a distinct shape plus the saturated `--tag-*-icon` tone, so the state is readable without relying on color alone: a dotted ring (pending), check / X / slash discs (succeeded / failed / cancelled), and a filled disc with an external ripple halo for the live running state (no spinner; honors reduced motion). Applied to the jobs graph nodes and the run-history rows. The run-header keeps its existing status `Badge` (its flat leading icon now matches the new glyph set).
- 417e220: Removes duplicate status icon from the workflow run summary, keeping only the status badge.
- 7a0ac44: Highlights workflow job graph edges on node hover with a neutral emphasis instead of the selected-job accent.
- 8fad235: Adds trigger source icons to workflow run rows so trigger metadata aligns with the status column.
- f880179: Replaces the trigger node rectangle in the workflow jobs graph with a circle containing only the trigger source icon, and shows the source label on hover via tooltip.
- 7341569: Add a per-step source action to the workflow run page with highlighted-line scrolling in the source panel.
- 8037501: Replace the local `StatusDot` in the workflow runs list with the shared `Dot`
  component from `@shipfox/react-ui`, mapping run status to the dot's native color
  variant. Active (running) runs show a blue rippling dot.

  Refine the selected run row: drop the washed-out orange-tinted fill and border in
  favor of a subtle neutral surface plus the existing orange "you are here" rail, so
  selection reads as intentional restraint rather than a faint brand wash.

  Re-align the status filter buttons to native `Button` variants instead of
  hardcoded highlight tokens: the active filter uses `primary`, the rest
  `transparent`.

  Tidy the runs list header: drop the redundant "Runs" title (already shown in the
  section selector above) and align the header inset with the run rows so the search
  box, filters, and run cards share one left edge.

  Match the runs list panel surface to the nav bar chrome: use
  `bg-background-subtle-base` (instead of a solid `bg-background-neutral-base` panel
  fill) so it reads as app chrome rather than a dedicated card, keeping only the
  right-edge separator.
