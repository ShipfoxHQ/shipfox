## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- ffd727b: Converges auth session and invitation state onto shared camelCase domain types validated at the API boundary, replacing the raw snake_case DTOs previously returned by login, signup, password reset, email verification, workspace creation, and invitation preview. `AuthState.user`, `useRefreshAuth()`, and `usePreviewInvitation()` now resolve to `UserIdentity`/`AuthenticatedSession`/`InvitationPreview` shapes (for example `accessToken` instead of `token`, `workspaceName` instead of `workspace_name`). Also moves the shared `AuthShell` component and session mapping helpers into `@shipfox/client-shell`, breaking the former `client-auth` ↔ `client-invitations` circular dependency.
