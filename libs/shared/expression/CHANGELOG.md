# @shipfox/expression

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bc7498: Adds job runner as a server-side interpolation field for execution-level runner selection.
- 26fea4b: Adds the authorable `steps` workflow context root and a shared field resolver for preserving residual interpolation plans.
- 0cf66c4: Adds ingest-time predicate foundations with filter predicate fields and boolean-shape detection.
- 8f51daf: Adds workflow template parsing with expression segments and conservative CEL root extraction for downstream interpolation checks.
- e689abf: Adds the v1 workflow context registry and interpolation field policies for typed, trust-tiered workflow interpolation.
- ce3e5ca: Adds residual workflow expression planning APIs for deferred field segments, runner-fill validation, server-evaluability checks, and monotone site fills.
- cdf8989: Adds shared CEL expression checks and evaluation behind Shipfox-owned APIs.
- 1127ba2: Adds safe run-command interpolation by hoisting resolved values into generated environment variables.
- 36f871d: Adds evaluation trace helpers for recording resolved workflow expressions with capped values and secret references.
- d546b88: Adds declared workflow field failure policies and a shared fail-closed predicate evaluator.
- 998eba3: Adds phase-aware workflow context metadata, availability predicates, and creation-phase workflow context assembly for runtime materialization.
- 5d53ed4: Adds workflow expression support for vars and runner-host secret contexts with literal-key validation.
- f0afdf8: Renames the step gate predicate from `success_if` to `success` and the restart payload from `on_failure.output` to `on_failure.feedback` across workflow authoring and predicate planning.
- 9d3b43a: Adds expected result type validation for typed workflow expressions.
- d635979: Routes workflow materialization and predicate evaluation through persisted planner segments, replacing resolver exports with planned freeze APIs.
- e0fee57: Promotes workflow jobs context and expands execution and step self-root expression shapes for workflow output references.
- fa67aa3: Reject workflow definitions whose step run/env/agent/name interpolation references a context root not yet available at that field's fill site, with a message naming when the root becomes available.
- ef1e917: Adds listening-job authoring fields and trusted execution context validation for listening jobs.
  Separates workflow identifiers so internal rows use UUID `id`, authored workflow/job/step
  references use `key`, and UI labels use `name`.
- 51eb38a: Adds the step.feedback interpolation field for server-side gate feedback templates.
- e2fbef8: Adds an open-map expression type so workflow predicates can type-check dynamic step output fields.
- 2ad300c: Adds typed step output coercion helpers for validating reported workflow outputs against declarations.
- a314b05: Adds workflow job output mapping support with execution-resolution interpolation planning.
- 1ea2f6a: Renames workflow context phases to availability sites, reshapes reserved roots, and adds sensitivity, host, and fill-target exports for planner context assembly.
- ad6056b: Adds workflow template resolution with string coercion, missing-path diagnostics, and typed evaluation failures.
- a856155: Adds typed workflow output declarations and expression overlays for validating downstream output references.

### Patch Changes

- e7b01dd: Adds the conditional workflow context surface and document fields for persisted if predicates.
- 58c05ed: Removes the unused resolved-field fill primitive from the expression package surface.
- 950ebef: Fixes fail-policy freezing for reserved server roots such as steps, jobs, and matrix.
- e1d4972: Evaluate the step gate `success_if` over the `step` self-root (`step.exit_code`, `step.status`) and job `success` over the full typed executions context, both validated against the shared context registry; authored gate expressions move from `exit_code` to `step.exit_code` and job-success now fails closed on a runtime evaluation error.
