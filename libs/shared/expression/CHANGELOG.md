# @shipfox/expression

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d559bdb]
  - @shipfox/workflow-document@3.7.0

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 10f23f7: Detects historical workflow event-payload dependencies and reports listener batch partition warnings.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [33f575e]
  - @shipfox/workflow-document@3.6.0

- bd5acd2: Bounds listener filter snapshots to referenced context paths and a separate 512 KiB `filter_snapshot` execution payload limit.

### Patch Changes

- @shipfox/workflow-document@3.5.0

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 351569e: Exposes the current workflow run attempt as `run.attempt` in expressions and reruns. Deploy compatible workers before adopting this field in persisted expressions because older builds omit it and cause those expressions to fail closed.
- 41e1cfc: Surfaces precise, safe trigger event errors in the event detail callout.

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 8825c23: Bounds evaluation traces to stay within the observation size budget while keeping deterministic prefixes and accurate dropped-entry counts.

### Minor Changes

- eb45f1d: Exposes bounded CEL evaluation diagnostics without runtime operands.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4f30864]
  - @shipfox/workflow-document@3.1.0

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3e7fe76: Adds shared `range()`, `toJson()`, and `fromJson()` functions to workflow expressions.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ce0984d: Preserve structured values when jobs map typed step outputs, normalize them for JSON persistence, and bound materialized job output sizes and entry counts.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ce0984d]
  - @shipfox/workflow-document@3.0.1

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7c4116e: Align predicate property types with their runtime shapes, replace `run.run_name` with `run.workflow_name`, and remove `failed` from `executions` entries.
- 045895c: Remove the unused workflow context trust metadata and related public exports. Allow
  external context in agent model and provider interpolations now that interpolation
  fields no longer enforce source tiers.
- adf07e7: Cut over workflow and job display names to literal-only `name` fields, with runtime interpolation supported through `run_name` and `execution_name`.
- ee2ce67: Split workflow definition facts out of the `run` context into a `workflow` root.
  `run.workflow_name` becomes `workflow.name` and `run.definition_id` becomes
  `workflow.id`, so `workflow` and `run` mirror the `job` and `execution` pair.
  Add `contextRootsForField` to return the readable roots for a predicate or an
  interpolation field without requiring the caller to choose a mechanism. Add
  `workflowContextDocs` as the reader-facing description of every root and property.

### Minor Changes

- dea1ffd: Expose normalized repository references on listening execution events.
- 3f781ee: Add workflow run and job execution naming fields to the authoring, expression, and normalized definition contracts.
- 285fff2: Persist resolved workflow job execution names and handle dynamic naming failures consistently.
- 4d246d4: Align predicate validation and runtime evaluation with field-specific context contracts.
- d77baaa: Add per-definition sequential numbers to workflow runs and expose them in the API and expression context.
- 41d558c: Add a pure shell code-position classifier for detecting workflow data passed to commands that re-evaluate their arguments.
- c2a8e54: Normalize checkout target fields for step-dispatch resolution, reject unsupported job-level checkout fields, and keep the workflow model and runtime checkout contracts aligned.
- cb0abfa: Expose the normalized trigger project, repository, ref, and commit in workflow context.

### Patch Changes

- 3d91d1d: Allow workflow context roots in interpolatable fields while preserving host and availability validation. Keep model and provider selection restricted to workflow-authored context so external payloads and step outputs cannot steer agent execution.
- 4444079: Warn when shell positions re-execute workflow-controlled values as code.

- 36f871d: Adds evaluation trace helpers for recording resolved workflow expressions with capped values and secret references.
- d546b88: Adds declared workflow field failure policies and a shared fail-closed predicate evaluator.
- 998eba3: Adds phase-aware workflow context metadata, availability predicates, and creation-phase workflow context assembly for runtime materialization.
- 5d53ed4: Adds workflow expression support for vars and runner-host secret contexts with literal-key validation.
- f0afdf8: Renames the step gate predicate from `success_if` to `success` and the restart payload from `on_failure.output` to `on_failure.feedback` across workflow authoring and predicate planning.
- 9d3b43a: Adds expected result type validation for typed workflow expressions.
- d635979: Routes workflow materialization and predicate evaluation through persisted planner segments, replacing resolver exports with planned freeze APIs.
- e0fee57: Promotes workflow jobs context and expands execution and step self-root expression shapes for workflow output references.
- fa67aa3: Reject workflow definitions whose step run/env/agent/name interpolation references a context root not yet available at that field's fill site, with a message naming when the root becomes available.
- ef1e917: Adds listening-job authoring fields and trusted execution context validation for listening jobs.
  Separates workflow identifiers so internal rows use UUID `id`, authored workflow/job/step
  references use `key`, and UI labels use `name`.
- 51eb38a: Adds the step.feedback interpolation field for server-side gate feedback templates.
- e2fbef8: Adds an open-map expression type so workflow predicates can type-check dynamic step output fields.

- a856155: Adds typed workflow output declarations and expression overlays for validating downstream output references.

### Patch Changes

- e7b01dd: Adds the conditional workflow context surface and document fields for persisted if predicates.
- 58c05ed: Removes the unused resolved-field fill primitive from the expression package surface.
- 950ebef: Fixes fail-policy freezing for reserved server roots such as steps, jobs, and matrix.
- e1d4972: Evaluate the step gate `success_if` over the `step` self-root (`step.exit_code`, `step.status`) and job `success` over the full typed executions context, both validated against the shared context registry; authored gate expressions move from `exit_code` to `step.exit_code` and job-success now fails closed on a runtime evaluation error.
