# @shipfox/workflow-document

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e9056c7: Adds workflow, job, and run-step env declarations for non-secret run-step configuration.
- 3afb7e3: Adds job execution success expressions and execution timeouts to workflow documents.
  Renames job execution IDs in auth, runner, workflow, and timeout event contracts to the explicit `jobExecutionId` / `job_execution_id` shape.
- eb7d5e8: Adds step gates with `success_if` and `on_failure` to the workflow document shape.
- 69d02e5: Adds job-level checkout permissions and persist-credentials fields to workflow documents.
- f63c6b0: Adds a shared workflow document package with a Zod contract and typed invalid-document error.
- ef1e917: Adds listening-job authoring fields and trusted execution context validation for listening jobs.
  Separates workflow identifiers so internal rows use UUID `id`, authored workflow/job/step
  references use `key`, and UI labels use `name`.
- f88aac9: Allows workflow agent steps to omit model, provider, and thinking while requiring only prompt.

### Patch Changes

- eb40964: Add an inline `agent` workflow step that the runner runs with the pi harness. A step is an agent step when it carries `model` + `prompt` and no `run`; it takes a free-text `model`, a single `prompt`, and an optional `thinking` level (default `high`). The step runs to process-success (the agent ran to completion) and reports through the existing step protocol with no runner/backend protocol change, so change quality is judged by a downstream `run` + `gate` step. v1 does not persist the agent's work (no diff, commit, or PR).
- b525dcd: Let an agent workflow step pick its pi provider with an optional free-text `provider` field (default `anthropic`), threaded to the runner's pi model lookup, and split agent-step failures into a user-fixable `agent_config_invalid` reason (unknown provider, missing runner credentials, wrong provider/model pair) versus `agent_invocation_failed` for genuine provider/API errors.
